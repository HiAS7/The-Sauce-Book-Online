# Tiefling

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score
increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.<br/>
**Age.** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but
live a few years longer.<br/>
**Alignment.** Tieflings might not have an innate
tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there.
Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many
tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.<br/>
**Size.** Tieflings are about the same size and build as
humans. Your size is Medium.<br/>
**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br/>
**Darkvision.** Thanks to your infernal heritage, you
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
canâ€™t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br/>
**Hellish Resistance.** You have resistance to fire damage.<br/>
**Infernal Legacy.** You know the thaumaturgy cantrip.
Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish
rebuke spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell. Once you
reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell
once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
these spells.<br/>
**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common
and Infernal.
