# Elf

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score
increases by 2.<br/>
**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about
the same age as humans, the elven understanding of
adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass
worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood
and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live
to be 750 years old.<br/>
**Alignment.** Elves love freedom , variety, and selfexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others'
freedom as well as their own, and they are more
often good than not. The drow are an exception; their
exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and
dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.<br/>
**Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and
have slender builds. Your size is Medium.<br/>
**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br/>
**Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night
sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it
were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br/>
**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the
Perception skill.<br/>
**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws
against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.<br/>
**Trance.** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they
meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4
hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation
is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a
fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that
have become reflexive through years of practice. After
resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a
human does from 8 hours of sleep.<br/>
**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common
and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and
intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied,
and their songs and poems are famous among other
races. Many bards learn their language so they can add
Elvish ballads to their repertoires.<br/>
**Subrace.** Ancient divides am ong the elven people
resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves,
and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose
one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces
are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon
elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can
choose a narrower subrace
