# Gnome
**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score
increases by 2.<br/>
**Age.** Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and
most are expected to settle down into an adult life by
around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.<br/>
**Alignment.** Gnomes are most often good. Those who
tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers,
scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend
toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers,
or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the 
tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.<br/>
**Size.** Gnom es are between 3 and 4 feet tall and
average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.<br/>
**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<br/>
**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you have
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br/>
**Gnome Cunning.** You have advantage on all
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws
against magic.<br/>
**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common
and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the
Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises
and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.<br/>
**Subrace.** Two subraces of gnom es are found among
the worlds of D&D: forest gnomes and rock gnomes.
Choose one of these subraces.

increases by 1.<br/>
**Natural Illusionist.** You know the minor illusion
cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.<br/>
**Speak with Small Beasts.** Through sounds and
gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small
or smaller beasts. Forest gnomes love animals and often
keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers,
and other creatures as beloved pets.

## Rock Gnome
**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score
increases by 1.<br/>
**Artificer’s Lore.** Whenever you make an Intelligence
(History) check related to magic items, alchemical
objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your
proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you
normally apply.<br/>
**Tinker.** You have proficiency with artisan’s tools
(tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1
hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny
clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases
to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour
repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when
you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can
reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up
to three such devices active at a time.
When you create a device, choose one of the
following options:
* **Clockwork Toy.** This toy is a clockwork animal, monster,
or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or
soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves
5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a
random direction. It makes noises as appropriate
to the creature it represents.
* **Fire Starter.** The device produces a miniature
flame, which you can use to light a candle,
torch, or campfire. Using the device
requires your action.
* **Music Box.** When opened, this music box
plays a single song at a moderate volume.
The box stops playing when it
reaches the song’s end or
when it is closed.
