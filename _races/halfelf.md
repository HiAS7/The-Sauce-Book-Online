# Half-Elf

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score
increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your
choice increase by 1.<br/>
**Age.** Half-elves mature at the same rate humans
do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They
live much longer than humans, however, often
exceeding 180 years.<br/>
**Alignment.** Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their
elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and
creative expression, demonstrating neither love
of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at
rules, resent others’ demands, and sometimes prove
unreliable, or at least unpredictable.<br/>
**Size.** Half-elves are about the same size as humans,
ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.<br/>
**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br/>
**Darkvision.** Thanks to your elf blood, you have
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br/>
**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws
against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.<br/>
**Skill Versatility.** You gain proficiency in two skills
of your choice.<br/>
**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common,
Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.
