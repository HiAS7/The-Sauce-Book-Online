<h3 id="class-features">Class features</h3>
<h5 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h5>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per druid level\
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier\
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your
Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st</p>

<h5 id="proficiencies">Proficiencies</h5>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will
not wear armor or use shields made of metal)\
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces,
quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears\
<strong>Tools:</strong> Herbalism kit
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Intelligence, Wisdom\
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Animal
Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception,
Religion, and Survival</p>

<h5 id="equipment">Equipment</h5>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon</li>
  <li>(a) a scim itar or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
  <li>Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="druidic">Druidic</h4>
<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You
can speak the language and use it to leave hidden
messages. You and others who know this language
automatically spot such a message. Others spot the
message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h4>
<p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you
can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See
chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and
chapter 11 for the druid spell list.</p>
<h5 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h5>
<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from
the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
known column of the Druid table.</p>
<h5 id="preparing-and-casting-spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>
<p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
you finish a long rest.\
You prepare the list of druid spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. when
you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to
your <strong>Wisdom modifier + your druid level</strong> (minimum of
one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom
of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells
of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare
the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can also change your list of prepared spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid
spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at
least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
<p><strong>Wisdom</strong> is your spellcasting ability for your druid
spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and
attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier\
<strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ritual-casting">Ritual Casting</h5>
<p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h5>
<p>You can use a druidic focus as a
spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>

<h4 id="wild-shape">Wild Shape</h4>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to
magically assume the shape of a beast that you have
seen before.\
You can use this feature twice. You regain
expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
Your druid level determines the beasts you can
transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At
2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast
that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t
have a flying or swimming speed.</p>
<h5 id="beast-shapes">Beast Shapes</h5>
<p>Level |Max. CR |Limitations |Example</p>
<ul>
  <li>|-|-|-
2nd |1/4| No flying or swimming speed| Wolf
4th |1/2| No flying speed| Crocodile
8th |1| —| Giant eagle
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours
equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then
revert to your normal form unless you expend another
use of this feature. You can revert to your normal
form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You
automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to
0 hit points, or die.
While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</li>
  <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of
the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality,
and Intelligence, Wisdom , and Charisma scores. You
also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in
addition to gaining those of the creature. If
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the
bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the
creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has
any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>
  <li>When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit
points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal
form, you return to the number of hit points you had
before you transformed. However, if you revert as a
result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
carries over to your normal form. For example, if you
take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit
point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as
the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form
to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>
  <li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or
take any action that requires hands is limited to the
capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t
break your concentration on a spell you’ve already
cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that
are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve
already cast.</li>
  <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them if the new
form is physically capable of doing so. However, you
can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
  <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the
ground in your space, merges into your new form, or
is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal,
but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new
form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape
and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match
the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must 
either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges 
with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="druid-circle">Druid Circle</h4>
<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#circle-of-the-land">Circle of the Land</a></li>
  <li><a href="#circle-of-the-land">Circle of the Moon</a></li>
  <li><a href="#circle-of-the-land">Circle of Dreams</a></li>
  <li><a href="#circle-of-the-land">Circle of the Shepherd</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th,
and 14th level.</p>
<h4 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of
your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores
of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an
ability score above 20 using this feature.\
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield
causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that
pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>
<h4 id="beast-spells">Beast Spells</h4>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid
spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You
can perform the somatic and verbal components of a
druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to
provide material components.</p>
<h4 id="archdruid">Archdruid</h4>
<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited
number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and 
somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material
components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a
spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape
and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p>

<h3 id="druid-circles">Druid Circles</h3>

<h4 id="circle-of-the-land">Circle of the Land</h4>

<h5 id="bonus-cantrip">Bonus Cantrip</h5>
<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one
additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>
<h5 id="natural-recovery">Natural Recovery</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your
magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing
with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended
spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
combined level that is equal to or less than half your
druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be
6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until
you finish a long rest.\
For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can
recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can
recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>
<h5 id="circle-spells">Circle Spells</h5>
<p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with
the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and
9th level you gain access to circle spells connected
to the land where you becam e a druid. Choose that
land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain,
swamp, or Underdark—and consult the associated
list of spells.\
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell
is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

<h5 id="lands-stride">Land’s Stride</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.\
You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being
slowed by them and without taking damage from them if
they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against
plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede
movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>
<h5 id="natures-ward">Nature’s Ward</h5>
<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or
frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to
poison and disease.</p>
<h5 id="natures-sanctuary">Nature’s Sanctuary</h5>
<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural
world sense your connection to nature and become
hesitant to attack you.\
When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must 
make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a 
failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the 
attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature
is immune to this effect for 24 hours.\
The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its
attack against you.</p>

<h4 id="circle-of-the-moon">Circle of the Moon</h4>

<h5 id="combat-wild-shape">Combat Wild Shape</h5>
<p>When you ch oose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the
ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action,
rather than as an action.
Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild
Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one
spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell
slot expended.</p>
<h5 id="circle-forms">Circle Forms</h5>
<p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform
into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd
level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a
beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore
the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must
abide by the other limitations there).\
Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast
with a challenge rating as high as your druid level
divided by 3, rounded down.</p>
<h5 id="primal-strike">Primal Strike</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
<h5 id="elemental-wild-shape">Elemental Wild Shape</h5>
<p>At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape
at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an
earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.</p>
<h5 id="thousand-forms">Thousand Forms</h5>
<p>By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter
your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the
alter self spell at will.</p>

<h4 id="circle-of-dreams">Circle of Dreams</h4>

<h5 id="balm-of-the-summer-court">BALM OF THE SUMMER COURT</h5>
<p>At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of
the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers
respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a 
number of d6s equal to your druid level.\
As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you
can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of l
those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the
spent dice and add them together. The target regains a :
number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary 
hit point per die spent.\
You regain all expended dice when you finish a
long rest.</p>
<h5 id="hearth-of-moonlight-and-shadow">HEARTH OF MOONLIGHT AND SHADOW</h5>
<p>At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a
short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of
the Gleaming Court to help guard your respite. At the
start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 
30-foot—radius sphere of magic appears, centered
on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.
While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5
bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception)
checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a l
campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it. \
The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you |
leave the sphere.</p>
<h5 id="hidden-paths">HIDDEN PATHS</h5>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical
pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the
blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can
teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can
see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport
one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you 
can see. You can use this feature a number of times equal to
your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses 
of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h5 id="walker-in-dreams">WALKER IN DREAMS</h5>
<p>At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you
the ability to travel mentally or physically through
dreamlands.\
When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the
following spells, without expending a spell slot or re- quiring material 
components: dream (with you as the messenger), scrying, or teleportation 
circle.\
This use of teleportation circle is special. Rather than
opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it
opens a portal to the last location where you finished
a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you
haven’t taken a long rest on your current plane, the
spell fails but isn’t wasted.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a long rest.</p>

<h4 id="circle-of-the-shepherd">Circle of the Shepherd</h4>

<h5 id="speech-of-the-woods">SPEECH OF THE WOODS</h5>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts
and many fey.\
You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addi‘
tion, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain
the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most
beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand
sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay
what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability
doesn’t grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this 
ability with gifts to curry favor with them
as you would with any nonplayer character.</p>

<h5 id="spirit-totem">SPIRIT TOTEM</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to
influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you
can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point
you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an
aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a 
creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the 
creature it represents.\
As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60
feet to a point you can see. The spirit persists for 1 minute or until 
you’re incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.\
The effect of.the spirit’s aura depends on the type of
spirit you summon from the options below.\
<strong>Bear Spirit.</strong> The bear spirit grants you and your allies
its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice
in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary
hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you
and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and
Strength saving throws while in the aura. \
<strong>Hawk Spirit.</strong> The hawk spirit is a consummate
hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight.
When a creature makes an attack roll against a target
in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant
advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your
allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
while in the aura.\
<strong>Unicorn Spirit.</strong> The unicorn spirit lends its protection
to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on
all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s
aura. In addition. if you cast a spell using a spell slot
that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside
the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also
regains hit points equal to your druid level.</p>

<h5 id="mighty-summoner">MIGHTY SUMMONER</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are
more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned
or created by a spell that you cast gains the. following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.</li>
  <li>The damage from its natural weapons is considered
magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and
resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.
    <h5 id="guardian-spirit">GUARDIAN SPIRIT</h5>
    <p>Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards
the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic.
When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with
a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that crea—
ture regains a number of hit points equal to half your
druid level.</p>
    <h5 id="faithful-summons">FAITHFUL SUMMONS</h5>
    <p>Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune
with protect you when you are the most defenseless.
If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated
against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits
of conjure animals as if it were cast using a 9th-level
spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are
challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear
within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from
you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes.
The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you 
dismiss it (no action required).\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.</p>
