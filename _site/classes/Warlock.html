<h4 id="otherworldly-patron">Otherworldly Patron</h4>
<p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an
otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the
Fiend, or the Great Old One,</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#the-archfey">The Archfey</a></li>
  <li><a href="#the-fiend">The Fiend</a></li>
  <li><a href="#the-great-old-one">The Great Old One</a></li>
  <li><a href="#the-celestial">The Celestial</a></li>
  <li><a href="#the-hexblade">The Hexblade</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Your choice
grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th,
and 14th level.</p>
<h4 id="pact-magic">Pact Magic</h4>
<p>Your arcane research and the magic bestow d on you
by your patron have given you facility with spells. See
chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and
chapter 11 for the warlock spell list.</p>
<h5 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h5>
<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock
spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
colum n of the Warlock table.</p>
<h5 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h5>
<p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have.
The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all
of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your
warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a
spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a short or long rest.\
For example, when you are 5th level, you have
two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell
thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and
you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
<h5 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice
from the warlock spell list.\
The Spells Known colum n of the Warlock table shows
when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st
level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level
no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level
colum n for your level. When you reach 6th level, for
example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be
1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the warlock spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the warlock
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock
spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack
roll with one.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier\
<strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier</p>
  <h5 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h5>
  <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for 
your warlock spells.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="eldritch-invocations">Eldritch Invocations</h4>
<p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch
invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that
imbue you with an abiding magical ability.\
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your
choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end
of the class description. When you gain certain warlock
levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice,
as shown in the Invocations Known colum n of the
Warlock table.\
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the invocations you know and
replace it with another invocation that you could learn
at that level.</p>
<h4 id="pact-boon">Pact Boon</h4>
<p>At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestow s a gift
upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the
following features of your choice.</p>
<h5 id="pact-of-the-chain">Pact of the Chain</h5>
<p>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a
ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of
spells known.\
When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the
normal form s for your familiar or one of the following
special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can
forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to
make one attack of its own.</p>
<h5 id="pact-of-the-blade">Pact of the Blade</h5>
<p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your
empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee
weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient 
with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for 
the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
attacks and damage.\
Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet
away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears
if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon
(no action required), or if you die.\
You can transform one magic weapon into your pact
weapon by perform ing a special ritual while you hold
the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course
of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an
extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you
create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an
artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon
ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform
the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use
a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon
appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space
when the bond breaks.</p>
<h5 id="pact-of-the-tome">Pact of the Tome</h5>
<p>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of
Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three
cantrips from any class’s spell list. While the book is on
your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They
don’t count against your number of cantrips known.
If you lose your B ook of Shadows, you can perform
a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your
patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short
or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book
turns to ash when you die.</p>
<h4 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h4 id="mystic-arcanum">Mystic Arcanum</h4>
<p>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical
secret called an arcanum. C hoose one 6th-level spell
from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without
expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before
you can do so again.\
At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your
choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell
at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one
9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your
Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="eldritch-master">Eldritch Master</h4>
<p>At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of
mystical pow er while entreating your patron to regain
expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating
your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots
from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots
with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you
can do so again.</p>

<h5 id="expanded-spell-list">Expanded Spell List</h5>

  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="fey-presence">Fey Presence</h5>
<p>Starting at 1st level, your patron bestow s upon you the
ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence
of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in
a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The
creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed
or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of
your next turn.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="misty-escape">Misty Escape</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in
response to harm. When you take damage, you can use
your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet
to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible
until the start of your next turn or until you attack or
cast a spell.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="beguiling-defenses">Beguiling Defenses</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to
turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against
them. You are immune to being charmed, and when
another creature attempts to charm you, you can use
your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on
that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or
be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature
takes any damage.</p>
<h5 id="dark-delirium">Dark Delirium</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into
an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature
that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a
Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save
DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you
(your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration
is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This
effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.\
Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost
in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose.
The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and
the illusion.\
You must finish a short or long rest before you can
use this feature again.</p>

<h4 id="the-fiend">The Fiend</h4>
<p>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower
planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil,
even if you strive against those aims. Such beings
desire the corruption or destruction of all things,
ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to
forge a pact include dem on lords such as Demogorgon,
Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such
as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial;
pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and
ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.</p>
<h5 id="expanded-spell-list-1">Expanded Spell List</h5>
<p>The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following
spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
Spell Level |Spells</p>
<ul>
  <li>|-
1st |burning hands, command
2nd |blindness/deafness, scorching ray
3rd |fireball, stinking cloud
4th |fire shield, wall of fire
5th |flame strike, hallow
    <h5 id="dark-ones-blessing">Dark One’s Blessing</h5>
    <p>Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature
to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your
Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).</p>
    <h5 id="dark-ones-own-luck">Dark One’s Own Luck</h5>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter
fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a
saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d 10 to
your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but
before any of the roll’s effects occur.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.\</p>
    <h5 id="fiendish-resilience">Fiendish Resilience</h5>
    <p>Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type
when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance
to that damage type until you choose a different one
with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or
silver weapons ignores this resistance.</p>
    <h5 id="hurl-through-hell">Hurl Through Hell</h5>
    <p>Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an
attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport
the target through the lower planes. The creature
disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.
At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the
space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied
space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d 10 psychic
damage as it reels from its horrific experience.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-great-old-one">The Great Old One</h4>
<p>Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is
utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from
the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be
one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives
are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so
immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries
pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The
Great Old One might be unaware of your existence
or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have
learned allow you to draw your magic from it.
Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That
Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the
Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu;
and other unfathomable beings.</p>
<h5 id="expanded-spell-list-2">Expanded Spell List</h5>
<p>The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list
of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following

3rd |clairvoyance, sending
4th |dominate beast, Evard’s black tentacles
5th |dominate person, telekinesis
    <h5 id="awakened-mind">Awakened Mind</h5>
    <p>Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you
the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You
can communicate telepathically with any creature you
can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share
a language with the creature for it to understand your
telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to
understand at least one language.</p>
    <h5 id="entropic-ward">Entropic Ward</h5>
    <p>At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against
attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good
luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack
roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose
disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your
next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you
make it before the end of your next turn.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    <h5 id="thought-shield">Thought Shield</h5>
    <p>Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can’t be read by
telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also
have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a
creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature
takes the same amount of damage that you do.</p>
    <h5 id="create-thrall">Create Thrall</h5>
    <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s
mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use
your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That
creature is then charmed by you until a remove curse
spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed
from it, or you use this feature again.\
You can communicate telepathically with the charmed
creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane
of existence.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-celestial">The Celestial</h4>

<h5 id="expanded-spell-list-3">EXPANDED SPELL LIST</h5>

5th |flame strike, greater restoration
    <h5 id="bonus-cantrips">BONUS CANTRIPS</h5>
    <p>At 1st level, you learn the light and sacred flame cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they
don’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p>
    <h5 id="healing-light">HEALING LIGHT</h5>
    <p>At lst level, you gain the ability to channel celestial
energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you
spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the
pool equals 1 + your warlock level.\
As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can
see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool.
The maximum number of dice you can spend at once
equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die).
Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore
a number of hit points equal to the total.\
Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a
long rest.</p>
    <h5 id="radiant-soul">RADIANT SOUL</h5>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows
you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have
resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell
that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that
spell against one of its targets.</p>
    <h5 id="celestial-resilience">CELESTIAL RESILIENCE</h5>
    <p>Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points
whenever you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points 
equal <strong>your warlock level + your Charisma modifier</strong>. Additionally, 
choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those 
creatures each gain temporary hit points 
equal to <strong>half your warlock level +your Charisma modifier</strong>.</p>
    <h5 id="searing-vengeance">SEARING VENGEANCE</h5>
    <p>Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel
allows you to resist death. When you have to make a
death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can
instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant
energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point
maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each
creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes
radiant damage equal to <strong>2d8 + your Charisma modifier</strong>,
and it is blinded until the end of the current turn.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-hexblade">The Hexblade</h4>

<h5 id="expanded-spell-list-4">EXPANDED SPELL LIST</h5>

4th |phantasmal killer, staggering smite
5th |banishing smite, cone of cold
    <h5 id="hexblades-curse">HEXBLADE’S CURSE</h5>
    <p>Starting at lst level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on 
someone. As a bonus action, choose one
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is
cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target
dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse
ends, you gain the following benefits:</p>
  </li>
  <li>You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed
target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.</li>
  <li>Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a
critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li>
  <li>If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal
to <strong>your warlock level + your Charisma modifier</strong> (minimum of 1 hit 
point).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="hex-warrior">HEX WARRIOR</h5>
<p>At lst level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with
medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon.
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one
weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks
the two-handed property. When you attack with that
weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of
Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later
gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends
to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon’s type.</p>
<h5 id="accursed-specter">ACCURSED SPECTER</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person
you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When
you slay a humanoid, you can cause its Spirit to rise from
its corpse as a <strong>specter</strong>, the statistics for which are in
the Monster Manual. When the specter appears, it gains
temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level.
Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns.
It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special
bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum of +0).\
The specter remains in your service until the end of
your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the
afterlife.\
Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can’t
use the feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h5 id="armor-or-hexes">ARMOR or HEXES</h5>
<p>At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your 
Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction 
to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless 
of its roll.</p>
<h5 id="master-of-hexes">MASTER OF HEXES</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade’s
Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When
the creature cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse dies,
you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 
feet of you, provided you aren’t incapacitated. When you apply the curse 
in this way, you don’t regain hit points from the death of the previously
cursed creature.</p>
