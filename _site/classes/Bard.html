<h3 id="class-features">Class features</h3>

<h5 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h5>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per bard level\
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier\
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your
Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st</p>

<h5 id="proficiencies">Proficiencies</h5>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor\
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords\
<strong>Tools:</strong> Three musical instruments of your choice\
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Charisma\
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose any three</p>

<h5 id="equipment">Equipment</h5>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon</li>
  <li>(a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer’s pack</li>
  <li>(a) a lute or (b) any other musical instrument</li>
  <li>Leather armor and a dagger</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="spellcasting"><a id="spellcasting-bard"></a>Spellcasting</h4>
<p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of
reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your
spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you
can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the
bard spell list.</p>
<h5 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h5>
<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard
spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
column of the Bard table.</p>
<h5 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h5>
<p>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure
wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</p>
<h5 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
<p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the
bard spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows
when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of
these spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you
reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell
of 1st or 2nd level.\
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you
can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace
it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
<p><strong>Charisma</strong> is your spellcasting ability for your bard
spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you
pour into the perform ance of your music or oration.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. \
In addition, you use your Charisma
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier \
<strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ritual-casting">Ritual Casting</h5>
<p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that
spell has the ritual tag.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h5>
<p>You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5)
as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p>

<h4 id="bardic-inspiration">Bardic Inspiration</h4>
<p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music.
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose
one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you
who can hear you. That creature gains one 
Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\
Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll
the die and add the number rolled to one <strong>ability check</strong>,
<strong>attack roll</strong>, or <strong>saving throw</strong> it makes. The creature can
wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the
Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM
says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic
Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have
only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You
regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach
certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th
level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>

<h4 id="jack-of-all-trades">Jack of All Trades</h4>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency
bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that
doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.</p>
<h4 id="song-of-rest">Song of Rest</h4>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or
oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during
a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can
hear your perform ance regain hit points at the end of
the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra
1d6 hit points.\
The extra hit points increase when you reach certain
levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d 10 at 13th
level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p>
<h4 id="bard-college">Bard College</h4>
<p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of
a bard college of your choice:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#college-of-lore">College of Lore</a></li>
  <li><a href="#college-of-valor">College of Valor</a></li>
  <li><a href="#college-of-glamour">College of Glamour</a></li>
  <li><a href="#college-of-swords">College of Swords</a></li>
  <li><a href="#college-of-whispers">College of Whispers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level
and again at 6th and 14th level.</p>
<h4 id="expertise"><a id="expertise-bard"></a>Expertise</h4>
<p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you
make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
At 10th level, you can choose another two skill
proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>
<h4 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h4 id="font-of-inspiration">Font of Inspiration</h4>
<p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of
your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you
finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h4 id="countercharm">Countercharm</h4>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or
words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As
an action, you can start a perform ance that lasts until
the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any
friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage
on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.
The perform ance ends early if you are incapacitated or
silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p>
<h4 id="magical-secrets">Magical Secrets</h4>
<p>By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge
from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells
from any class, including this one. A spell you choose
must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip.
The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are
included in the number in the Spells Known column of
the Bard table.
You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th
level and again at 18th level.</p>
<h4 id="superior-inspiration">Superior Inspiration</h4>
<p>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses
of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</p>

<h3 id="bard-colleges">Bard Colleges</h3>

<h4 id="college-of-lore">College of Lore</h4>

<h5 id="bonus-proficiencies">Bonus Proficiencies</h5>
<p>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency with three skills of your choice.</p>
<h5 id="cutting-words">Cutting Words</h5>
<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to
distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and
competence of others. When a creature that you can
see within 60 feet of you makes an <strong>attack roll</strong>, an
<strong>ability check</strong>, or a <strong>damage roll</strong>, you can 
use your reaction toexpend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration,
rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number
rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use
this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before
the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check 
succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its
damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if
it’s immune to being charmed.</p>
<h5 id="additional-magical-secrets">Additional Magical Secrets</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any
class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast,
as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen
spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count
against the number of bard spells you know.</p>
<h5 id="peerless-skill">Peerless Skill</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check,
you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a
Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to
your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roil
the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you
whether you succeed or fail.</p>

<h4 id="college-of-valor">College of Valor</h4>

<h5 id="bonus-proficiencies-1">Bonus Proficiencies</h5>
<p>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you
gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and
martial weapons.</p>
<h5 id="combat-inspiration">Combat Inspiration</h5>
<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle.
A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you
can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon
<strong>damage roll</strong> it just made. Alternatively, when an attack
roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction
to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number
rolled to its <strong>AC</strong> against that attack, after seeing the roll
but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</p>
<h5 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues
your allies with vigor and speed.\

Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appear- ance. When you do 
so, choose a number of creatures you can see and that can see you within 
60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of

these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up 
to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.\

<h5 id="enthralling-performance">ENTHRALLING PERFORMANCE</h5>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can charge your performance
with seductive, fey magic.\
If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt
to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting
a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance,
choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you
who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number
equal tO your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).
Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While
charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks
glowingly Of you to anyone who talks to it, and it hinders
anyone who Opposes you, although it avoids violence
unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf.
This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any
damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking
or damaging any of its allies.\
If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has
nO hint that you tried tO charm it.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="mantle-of-majesty">MANTLE OF MAJESTY</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey
magic that makes Others want to serve you. As a bonus
action, you cast command, without expending a spell
slot, and you take on an appearance of unearthly beauty
for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were 
concentrating on a spell). During this time, you
can cast command as a bonus action on each of your
turns, without expending a spell slot.\
Any creature charmed by you automatically fails
its saving throw against the command you cast with
this feature.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.</p>
<h5 id="unbreakable-majesty">UNBREAKABLE MAJESTY</h5>
<p>At 14th level, your appearance permanently gains an
otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely
and fierce.\

presence for 1 minute or until you are
incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature
tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the at—
tacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a failed save, it can’t attack you on this
turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the
attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you
on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw
it makes against your spells on your next turn.\
Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do
so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

<h4 id="college-of-whispers">College of Whispers</h4>
<h5 id="psychic-blades">PSYCHIC BLADES</h5>
<p>When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you
gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically
toxic to a creature’s mind.\

extra 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so

you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the
end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw 
against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of 
your choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is 
attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or 
damaged.\
If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target
has no hint that you tried to frighten it.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="mantle-of-whispers">MANTLE OF WHISPERS</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid’s
persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you,
you can magically capture its shadow using your reac—
tion. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish
a long rest.\
You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so,
it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that
appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but
healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until
you end it as a bonus action.\
While you’re in the disguise, you gain access to all
information that the humanoid would freely share with
a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its 
background and personal life, but doesn’t include secrets. The information 
is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on
its memories.\
Another creature can see through this disguise by
succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by
your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus
to your check.\

into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears.
As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that
only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you
can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds
if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear
you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds
like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.
On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you
for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it,
damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers 
as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of 
this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.
The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear
that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for
you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to
do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a
close friend.\
When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you 
in such fear.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.</p>
