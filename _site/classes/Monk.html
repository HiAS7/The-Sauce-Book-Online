<h3 id="class-features">Class features</h3>
<h5 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h5>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per monk level\
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier\
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your
Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>
<h5 id="proficiencies">Proficiencies</h5>
<p><strong>Armor:</strong> None\
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, shortswords\
<strong>Tools:</strong> Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one
musical instrument\
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Dexterity\
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History,
Insight, Religion, and Stealth</p>
<h5 id="equipment">Equipment</h5>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon</li>
  <li>(a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
  <li>10 darts</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="-unarmored-defense"><a id="unarmored-defense-monk"></a> Unarmored Defense</h4>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor
and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your
Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
<h4 id="martial-arts">Martial Arts</h4>
<p>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you
mastery of combat styles that use unarm ed strikes and
monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple
melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or
heavy property.\
You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed
or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing
armor or wielding a shield:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the
attack and damage rolls of your unarm ed strikes and
monk weapons.</li>
  <li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage
of your unarm ed strike or monk weapon. This die
changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the
Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>
  <li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed
strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make
one unarm ed strike as a bonus action. For example, if
you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarm ed strike as a bonus
action, assum ing you haven’t already taken a bonus
action this turn.\
Certain monasteries use specialized form s of the
monk weapons. For example, you might use a club
that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain
(called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter
blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a
monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided
for the weapon in chapter 5.
    <h4 id="ki">Ki</h4>
    <p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to
harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this
energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your
monk level determines the number of points you have,
as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.
You can spend these points to fuel various ki features.
You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows,
Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more
ki features as you gain levels in this class\
When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until
you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you
draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You
must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to
regain your ki points.\
Some of your ki features require your target to make
a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving
throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Ki save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier</p>
      <h5 id="flurry-of-blows">Flurry of Blows</h5>
      <p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your
turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed
strikes as a bonus action.</p>
      <h5 id="patient-defense">Patient Defense</h5>
      <p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the D odge action as a
bonus action on your turn.</p>
      <h5 id="step-of-the-wind">Step of the Wind</h5>
      <p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash
action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump
distance is doubled for the turn.</p>
      <h4 id="unarmored-movement">Unarmored Movement</h4>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet
while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.
This bonus increases when you reach certain monk
levels, as shown in the Monk table.\
At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical
surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling
during the move.</p>
      <h4 id="monastic-tradition">Monastic Tradition</h4>
      <p>When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a
monastic tradition:</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#way-of-the-open-hand">Way of the Open Hand</a></li>
  <li><a href="#way-of-shadow">Way of Shadow</a></li>
  <li><a href="#way-of-the-four-elements">Way of the Four Elements</a></li>
  <li><a href="#way-of-the-drunken-master">Way of the Drunken Master</a></li>
  <li><a href="#way-of-the-kensei">Way of the Kensei</a></li>
  <li><a href="#way-of-the-sun-soul">Way of the Sun Soul</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Your tradition
grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th,
and 17th level.</p>
<h4 id="deflect-missiles">Deflect Missiles</h4>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to
deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged
weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take
from the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your monk level.\
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the
missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand
and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a
missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a
ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition
you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make
this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon
proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon
for the attack.</p>
<h4 id="abilility-score-improvement">Abilility Score Improvement</h4>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.</p>

<h4 id="slow-fall">Slow Fall</h4>
<p>Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when
you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an
amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>

<h4 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h4>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
<h4 id="stunning-strike">Stunning Strike</h4>
<p>Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of
ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature
with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to
attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of
your next turn.</p>
<h4 id="ki-empowered-strikes">Ki-Empowered Strikes</h4>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
<h4 id="evasion"><a id="evasion-monk"></a>Evasion</h4>
<p>At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge
out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue
dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you
are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you
instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving
throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
<h4 id="stillness-of-mind">Stillness of Mind</h4>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one
effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed
or frightened.</p>
<h4 id="purity-of-body">Purity of Body</h4>
<p>At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you
m akes you im mune to disease and poison.</p>
<h4 id="tongue-of-the-sun-and-moon">Tongue of the Sun and Moon</h4>
<p>Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other
minds so that you understand all spoken languages.
Moreover, any creature that can understand a language
can understand what you say.</p>
<h4 id="diamond-soul">Diamond Soul</h4>
<p>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you
proficiency in all saving throws.\
Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and
fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the
second result.\
During that time, you also have resistance to all damage
but force damage.\
Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the
astral projection spell, without needing material
components. When you do so, you can’t take any other
creatures with you.</p>
<h4 id="timeless-body">Timeless Body</h4>
<p>At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer
none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged
magically. You can still die of old age, however. In
addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>
<h4 id="empty-body">Empty Body</h4>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to
spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute.</p>
<h4 id="perfect-self">Perfect Self</h4>
<p>At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki
points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>

<h3 id="monastic-traditions">Monastic Traditions</h3>

<h4 id="way-of-the-open-hand">Way of the Open Hand</h4>

<h5 id="open-hand-technique">Open Hand Technique</h5>
<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level,
you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness
your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the
attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can im pose
one of the following effects on that target:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be
knocked prone.</li>
  <li>It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you
can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</li>
  <li>It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="wholeness-of-body">Wholeness of Body</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an
action, you can regain hit points equal to three times
your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you
can use this feature again.</p>

<h5 id="tranquility">Tranquility</h5>
<p>Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special
meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At
the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary
spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the
spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC
for the spell equals</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.</strong></p>
  <h5 id="quivering-palm">Quivering Palm</h5>
  <p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal
vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature
with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to
start these im perceptible vibrations, which last for a
number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations
are harm less unless you use your action to end them.
To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane
of existence. When you use this action, the creature
must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is
reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10
necrotic damage.\
You can have only one creature under the effect of this
feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations
harmlessly without using an action.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="way-of-shadow">Way of Shadow</h4>
<h5 id="shadow-arts">Shadow Arts</h5>
<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you
can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells.
As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness,
darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without
providing material components. Additionally, you gain
the minor illusion cantrip if you don’t already know it.</p>
<h5 id="shadow-step">Shadow Step</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow
into another. When you are in dim light or darkness,
as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an
unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light
or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee
attack you make before the end of the turn.</p>
<h5 id="cloak-of-shadows">Cloak of Shadows</h5>
<p>By 11th level, you have learned to become one with
the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or
darkness, you can use your action to become invisible.
You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a
spell, or are in an area of bright light.</p>
<h5 id="opportunist">Opportunist</h5>
<p>At 17th level, you can exploit a creature’s momentary
distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a
creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by
a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to
make a melee attack against that creature.</p>

<h4 id="way-of-the-four-elements">Way of the Four Elements</h4>
<h5 id="disciple-of-the-elements">Disciple of the Elements</h5>
<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn
magical disciplines that harness the power of the four
elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points
each time you use it.\
You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and
one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are
detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below.
You learn one additional elemental discipline of your
choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\
Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline,
you can also replace one elemental discipline that you
already know with a different discipline.\
<strong>Casting Elemental Spells.</strong> Some elemental
disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these
spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you
don’t need to provide material components for it.
Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend
additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental
discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has
an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands
does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional
ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level
monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning
hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level
spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).\
The maximum number of ki points you can spend to
cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost
and any additional ki points you spend to increase its
level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the
Spells and Ki Points table.</p>
