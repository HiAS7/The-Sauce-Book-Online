<h5 id="equipment">Equipment</h5>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger</li>
  <li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>
  <li>(a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
  <li>A spellbook</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="spellcasting"><a id="spellcasting-wizard"></a>Spellcasting</h4>
<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook
containing spells that show the first glimm erings of
your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
<h5 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h5>
<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice
from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as show n in the
Cantrips K now n colum n of the Wizard table.</p>

<h5 id="spellbook">Spellbook</h5>
<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level
wizard spells of your choice.</p>
<h5 id="your-spellbook">Your Spellbook</h5>
<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels
reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well
as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature
of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your
adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in
an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an
ancient library.\
<strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong> When you find a wizard spell
of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is
of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare
the time to decipher and copy it.\
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing
the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique
system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You
must practice the spell until you understand the sounds
or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook
using your own notation.\
For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and
costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you
expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well
as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent
this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your
other spells.\
<strong>Replacing the Book.</strong> You can copy a spell from your own
spellbook into another book— for example, if you want
to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like
copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier,
since you understand your own notation and already know
how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp
for each level of the copied spell.\
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure
to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new
spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook
requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this
reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\
<strong>The Book’s Appearance.</strong> Your spellbook is a unique
compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and
margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume
that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound
gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a
loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost
your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>

<h5 id="preparing-and-casting-spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>
<p>The Wizard table show s how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.\
You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available
for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard
spells from your spellbook equal to your <strong>Intelligence
modifier + your wizard level</strong> (minimum of one spell). The
spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an
Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can
include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination,
chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a
2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from
your list of prepared spells.\
You can change your list of prepared spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard
spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and
m em orizing the incantations and gestures you must
make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level
for each spell on your list.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
<p><strong>Intelligence</strong> is your spellcasting ability for your wizard
spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated
study and mem orization. You use your Intelligence
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier\
<strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +
your intelligence modifier</p>
  <h5 id="ritual-casting">Ritual Casting</h5>
  <p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has
the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook.
You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>
  <h5 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h5>
  <p>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
  <h5 id="learning-spells-of-1st-level-and-higher">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
  <p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two
wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each
of these spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your
adventures, you might find other spells that you can add
to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="arcane-recovery">Arcane Recovery</h4>
<p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy
by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you
finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots
to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that
is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded
up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover
up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either
a 2nd-level spell slot or tw o 1st-level spell slots.</p>
<h4 id="arcane-tradition">Arcane Tradition</h4>
<p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane
tradition, shaping your practice of magic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#school-of-abjuration">School of Abjuration</a></li>
  <li><a href="#school-of-conjuration">School of Conjuration</a></li>
  <li><a href="#school-of-divination">School of Divination</a></li>
  <li><a href="#school-of-enchantment">School of Enchantment</a></li>
  <li><a href="#school-of-evocation">School of Evocation</a></li>
  <li><a href="#school-of-illusion">School of Illusion</a></li>
  <li><a href="#school-of-necromancy">School of Necromancy</a></li>
  <li><a href="#school-of-transmutation">School of Transmutation</a></li>
  <li><a href="#war-magic">War Magic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again
at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>
<h4 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h4 id="spell-mastery">Spell Mastery</h4>
<p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over
certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a
1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that
are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their
lowest level without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a
higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one
or both of the spells you chose for different spells of
the same levels.</p>
<h4 id="signature-spells">Signature Spells</h4>
<p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two
powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.
Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook
as your signature spells. You always have these spells
prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells
you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at
3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so,
you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you
must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>

<h3 id="arcane-traditions">Arcane Traditions</h3>

<h4 id="school-of-abjuration">School of Abjuration</h4>

<h5 id="abjuration-savant">Abjuration Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration
spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h5 id="arcane-ward">Arcane Ward</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around
yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration
spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a
strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on
yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward
has hit points equal to tw ice your wizard level + your
Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the
ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces
the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.
While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb
damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an
abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a
number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.
Once you create the ward, you can’t create it again
until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h5 id="projected-ward">Projected Ward</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see
within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your
reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that
damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points,
the warded creature takes any remaining damage.</p>
<h5 id="improved-abjuration">Improved Abjuration</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration
spell that requires you to make an ability check as
a part of casting that spell (as in counterspell and
dispel magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that
ability check.</p>
<h5 id="spell-resistance">Spell Resistance</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving
throws against spells.\
Furthermore, you have resistance against the
damage of spells.</p>

<h5 id="school-of-conjuration">School of Conjuration</h5>
<p>As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects
and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing
clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from
elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery
grows, you learn spells of transportation and can
teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other
planes of existence, in an instant.</p>
<h5 id="conjuration-savant">Conjuration Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell
into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h5 id="minor-conjuration">Minor Conjuration</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you
can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object
in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space
that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be
no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than
10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical
object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical,
radiating dim light out to 5 feet.\
The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this
feature again, or if it takes any damage.</p>
<h5 id="benign-transposition">Benign Transposition</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport
up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.
Alternatively, you can choose a space within range
that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that
creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of
1st level or higher.</p>
<h5 id="focused-conjuration">Focused Conjuration</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on
a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken
as a result of taking damage.</p>
<h5 id="durable-summons">Durable Summons</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, any creature that you
summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30
temporary hit points.</p>

<h4 id="school-of-divination">School of Divination</h4>
<p>The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and
commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding
of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive
to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so
that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of
discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge,
and foresight.</p>
<h5 id="divination-savant">Divination Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell
into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h5 id="portent">Portent</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school,
glimpses of the future begin to press in on your
awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s
and record the num bers rolled. You can replace any
attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or
a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling
rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you
can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.
Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you
finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
<h5 id="expert-divination">Expert Divination</h5>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes
so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your
spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell
of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one
expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a
level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher
than 5th level.</p>
<h5 id="the-third-eye">The Third Eye</h5>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to
increase your pow ers of perception. When you do so,
choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until
you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest.
You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.\
<strong>Darkvision.</strong> You gain darkvision out to a range of 60
feet.\
<strong>Ethereal Sight.</strong> You can see into the Ethereal Plane
within 60 feet of you.\
<strong>Greater Comprehension.</strong> You can read any language.\
<strong>See Invisibility.</strong> You can see invisible creatures and
objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.</p>
<h5 id="greater-portent">Greater Portent</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dream s
intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind
of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent
feature, rather than two.</p>

<h4 id="school-of-enchantment">School of Enchantment</h4>
<p>As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have
honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile
other people and monsters. S om e enchanters are
peacem akers who bewitch the violent to lay down their
arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others
are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their
service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.</p>
<h5 id="enchantment-savant">Enchantment Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment
spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h5 id="hypnotic-gaze">Hypnotic Gaze</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your
soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall
another creature. A s an action, choose one creature that
you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or
hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you
until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s
speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and
visibly dazed.\
On subsequent turns, you can use your action to
maintain this effect, extending its duration until the
end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you
move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the
creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature
takes damage.\
Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its
initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this
feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h5 id="instinctive-charm">Instinctive Charm</h5>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see
within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against
you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack,
provided that another creature is within the attack’s
range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw
against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save,
the attacker must target the creature that is closest
to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures
are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.
On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the
attacker again until you finish a long rest.
You must choose to use this feature before knowing
whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t
be charmed are im mune to this effect.</p>
<h5 id="split-enchantment">Split Enchantment</h5>
<p>Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment
spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature,
you can have it target a second creature.</p>
<h5 id="alter-memories">Alter Memories</h5>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature
unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast
an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures,
you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it
remains unaware of being charmed.\
Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can
use your action to try to make the chosen creature
forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature
must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against
your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours
of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier
(minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less
time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration
of your enchantment spell.</p>

<h4 id="school-of-evocation">School of Evocation</h4>
<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful
elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame,
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid.
Some evokers find employment in military forces,
serving as artillery to blast enemy arm ies from afar.
Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak,
while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers,
or aspiring tyrants.</p>
<h5 id="evocation-savant">Evocation Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell
into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h5 id="sculpt-spells">Sculpt Spells</h5>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of
relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells.
When you cast an evocation spell that affects other
creatures that you can see, you can choose a number
of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen
creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws
against the spell, and they take no damage if they would
normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>
<h5 id="potent-cantrip">Potent Cantrip</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect
even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When
a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your
cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if
any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
<h5 id="empowered-evocation">Empowered Evocation</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence
modifier to the damage roll of any wizard evocation
spell you cast.</p>
<h5 id="overchannel">Overchannel</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the pow er of
your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of
5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal
maximum damage with that spell.\
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect.
If you use this feature again before you finish a long
rest, you take 2d 12 necrotic dam age for each level of
the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you
use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the
necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d 12. This
damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>

<h4 id="school-of-illusion">School of Illusion</h4>
<p>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the
senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest
folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by
your keen mind make the im possible seem real. Som e
illusionists—including many gnom e wizards—are
benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain.
Others are more sinister masters of deception, using
their illusions to frighten and fool others for their
personal gain.</p>
<h5 id="illusion-savant">Illusion Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell
into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h5 id="improved-minor-illusion">Improved Minor Illusion</h5>
<p>When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn
the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this
cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your
choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number
of cantrips known.\
When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a
sound and an im age with a single casting of the spell.</p>
<h5 id="malleable-illusions">Malleable Illusions</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that
has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your
action to change the nature of that illusion (using the
spell’s norm al parameters for the illusion), provided that
you can see the illusion.</p>
<h5 id="illusory-self">Illusory Self</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory
duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual
reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack
roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose
the illusory duplicate between the attacker and
yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the
illusion dissipates.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="illusory-reality">Illusory Reality</h5>
<p>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving
shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality.
When you  cast an illusion spell of 1st level or
higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical
object that is part of the illusion and make that object
real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action
while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for
1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a
bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough
for your allies to cross.\
The object can’t deal damage or otherwise
directly harm anyone.</p>

<h4 id="school-of-necromancy">School of Necromancy</h4>
<p>The School of Necromancy explores the cosm ic forces
of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in
this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that
animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to
sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys
its body, transforming that vital energy into magical
pow er you can manipulate.\
Most people see necrom ancers as menacing, or even
villainous, due to the close association with death.
Not all necrom ancers are evil, but the forces they
manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.</p>
<h5 id="necromancy-savant">Necromancy Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a necrom ancy
spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h5 id="grim-harvest">Grim Harvest</h5>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from
creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when
you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level
or higher, you regain hit points equal to tw ice the spell’s
level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the
School of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for
killing constructs or undead.</p>
<h5 id="undead-thralls">Undead Thralls</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your
spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast
animate dead, you can target one additional corpse
or pile of bones, creating another zom bie or skeleton,
as appropriate.\
Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy
spell, it has additional benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an
amount equal to your wizard level.</li>
  <li>The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its
weapon damage rolls.
    <h5 id="inured-to-undeath">Inured to Undeath</h5>
    <p>Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic
damage, and your hit point maximum can’t be reduced.
You have spent so much time dealing with undead and
the forces that animate them that you have become
inured to some of their worst effects.</p>
    <h5 id="command-undead">Command Undead</h5>
    <p>Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring
undead under your control, even those created by other
wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that
you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must
make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard
spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature
on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and
obeys your commands until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way.
If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has
advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving
throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can
repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it
succeeds and breaks free.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="school-of-transmutation">School of Transmutation</h4>
<p>You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter.
To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently
mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change.
You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both
physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives
you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.
Som e transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters,
turning people into toads and transforming copper into
silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their
magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the
pow er of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</p>
<h5 id="transmutation-savant">Transmutation Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation
spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
<h5 id="minor-alchemy">Minor Alchemy</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you
can temporarily alter the physical properties of one
nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into
another. You perform a special alchem ical procedure
on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not
a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into
a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes
you spend perform ing the procedure, you can transform
up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you
lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on
a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.</p>
<h5 id="transmuters-stone">Transmuter’s Stone</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a
transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You
can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another
creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice
as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession.
When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the
following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in
chapter 8</li>
  <li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is
unencumbered</li>
  <li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws</li>
  <li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder
damage (your choice whenever you choose this
benefit)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level
or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the
stone is on your person.\
If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous
one ceases to function.</p>
<h5 id="shapechanger">Shapechanger</h5>
<p>At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your
spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast
polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you
do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a
beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.\
Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can’t do so
again until you finish a short or long rest, though you
can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.</p>
<h5 id="master-transmuter">Master Transmuter</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to
consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored
within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When
you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your
transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade
until you finish a long rest.\
<strong>Major Transformation.</strong> You can transmute one
nonmagical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into
another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and
of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes
handling the object to transform it.\
<strong>Panacea.</strong> You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons
affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s
stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.\
<strong>Restore Life.</strong> You cast the raise dead spell on a
creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without
expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in
your spellbook.\
<strong>Restore Youth.</strong> You touch the transmuter’s stone to
a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is
reduced by 3 d 10 years, to a minim um of 13 years. This
effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.</p>

<h4 id="war-magic">War Magic</h4>

<h5 id="arcane-deflection">ARCANE DEFLECTION</h5>
<p>At 2nd level, you have learned to weave your magic to
fortify yourself against harm. When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction
to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4
bonus to that saving throw.\
When you use this feature, you can’t cast spells other
than cantrips until the end of your next turn.</p>

<h5 id="tactical-wit">TACTICAL WIT</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, your keen ability to assess tactical
situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can
give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your
Intelligence modifier.</p>
<h5 id="power-surge">POWER SURGE</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can store magical energy
within yourself to later empower your damaging spells.
In its stored form, this energy is called a power surge.
You can store a maximum number of power surges
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).\
Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power
surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end
a spell with dispel magic or counterspel], you gain one
power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you
foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you
gain one power surge.\
Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature
or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power
surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals <strong>half your wizard level</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="durable-magic">DURABLE MAGIC</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps
ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a
spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.</p>
<h5 id="deflecting-shroud">DEFLECTING SHROUD</h5>
<p>At 14th level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused
with deadly magic. When you use your Arcane Deflection feature, you can 
cause magical energy to are from you. Up to three creatures of your 
choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal
to half your wizard level.</p>
