<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score
increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.<br />
<strong>Age.</strong> Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans.
They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live
less than a century.<br />
<strong>Alignment.</strong> Goliath society, with its clear roles and
tasks, has a strong lawful bent. The goliath sense of fairness, balanced with an emphasis on self-sufficiency and
personal accountability, pushes them toward neutrality.<br />
<strong>Size.</strong> Goliaths are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh
between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.<br />
<strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br />
<strong>Natural Athlete.</strong> You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.<br />
<strong>Stone’s Endurance.</strong> You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you
can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it
again until you finish a short or long rest.<br />
<strong>Powerful Build.</strong> You count as one size larger when
determining your carrying capacity and the weight you
can push, drag, or lift.<br />
<strong>Mountain Born.</strong> You’re acclimated to high altitude,
including elevations above 20,000 feet. You’re also naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5
of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.<br />
<strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common
and Giant.</p>
