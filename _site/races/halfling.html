<strong>Age.</strong> A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of

<strong>Alignment.</strong> Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule,
they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in
pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are
also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on
the support of their community and the comfort of
their old ways.<br />

<strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Comon

halflings are loath to share it with others. They write
very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature.
Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all
halflings speak Common to converse with the people
in whose lands they dwell or through which they
are traveling.<br />
<strong>Subrace.</strong> The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and
stout, are more like closely related fam ilies than true
subraces. Choose one of these subraces</p>
