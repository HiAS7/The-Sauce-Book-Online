and Charisma scores each increase by 1.<br />
<strong>Age.</strong> Tritons reach maturity around age 15 and can
live up to 200 years.<br />
<strong>Alignment.</strong> Tritons tend toward lawful good. As
euardians of the darkest reaches of the sea, their culture
pushes them toward order and benevolence. <br />

<strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you
have a swimming speed of 30 feet.<br />
<strong>Amphibious.</strong> You can breathe air and water.
<strong>Control Air and Water.</strong> A child of the sea, you can call
on the magic of elemental air and water. You can cast
fog cloud with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can
cast gust of wind with it, and starting at 5th level, you
can also cast wall of water with it (see the spell in the
sidebar). Once you cast a spell with this trait, you can’t
do so again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your
spellcasting ability for these spells.<br />
<strong>Emissary of the Sea.</strong> Aquatic beasts have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate
simple ideas with beasts that can breathe water. They
can understand the meaning of your words, though you
have no special ability to understand them in return.<br />
<strong>Guardians of the Depths.</strong> Adapted to even the most
extreme ocean depths, you have resistance to cold damage, and you ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a
deep, underwater environment.<br />
<strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common
and Primordial.</p>
