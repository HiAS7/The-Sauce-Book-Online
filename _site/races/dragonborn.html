<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score
increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.<br />
<strong>Age.</strong> Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk
hours after hatching, attain the size and development
of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach
adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.<br />
<strong>Alignment.</strong> Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a
conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic
war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut
and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good,
but those who side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.<br />
<strong>Size.</strong> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans,
standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250
pounds. Your size is Medium.<br />
<strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br />
<strong>Draconic Ancestry.</strong> You have draconic ancestry.
Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry
table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are
determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.
Breath Weapon. You can use your action to exhale
destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines
the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.
When you use your breath weapon, each creature in
the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw,
the type of which is determined by your draconic
ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half
as much damage on a successful one. The damage
increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6
at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you canâ€™t use it
again until you complete a short or long rest.<br />
<strong>Damage Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to the
damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.<br />
<strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common
and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the
oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic.
The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and
includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</p>
