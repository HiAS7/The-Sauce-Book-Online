<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong>
Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br />
<strong>Age.</strong>
Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate
as humans.<br />
<strong>Alignment.</strong>
Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality.
Those who join the Selesnya are more often neutral
good, while those who join the Gruul are typically chaotic neutral.<br />
<strong>Size.</strong> 
Centaurs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with
their equine bodies reaching about 4 feet at the withers.
Your size is Medium.<br />
<strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 40 feet.<br />
<strong>Fey.</strong> Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid.
Charge. If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a
target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the
same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a
bonus action, making one attack against the target with
your hooves.<br />
<strong>Hooves.</strong> Your hooves are natural melee weapons,
which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit
with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to ld4 +
your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.<br />
<strong>Equine Build.</strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can
push or drag.<br />
In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is
especially difficult for you because of you r equine legs.
When you make such a climb, each foot of movement
costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.<br />
<strong>Survivor.</strong> You have proficiency in one of the following
skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.<br />
<strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common
and Sylvan. Sylvan is widely spoken in the Selesnya
Conclave, for it is rich in vocabulary to describe natural
phenomena and spiritual forces.</p>
