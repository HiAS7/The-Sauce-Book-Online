<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br />
<strong>Age.</strong> Lizardfolk reach maturity arqund age 14 and
rarely live longer than 60 years.<br />
<strong>Alignment.</strong> Most lizardfolk are neutral. They see the
world as a place of predators and prey, where life and
death are natural processes. They wish only to survive,
and prefer to leave other creatures to their own devices.<br />
<strong>Size.</strong> Lizardfolk are a little bulkier and taller than
humans, and their colorful frills make them appear even
larger. Your size is Medium.<br />
<strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you
have a swimming speed of 30 feet.<br />
<strong>Bite.</strong> Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you
can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you
deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.<br />
<strong>Cunning Artisan.</strong> As part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon,
monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger
to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a
javelin, or 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. To use this
trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate
artisan’s tools, such as leatherworker’s tools.<br />
<strong>Hold Breath.</strong> You can hold your breath for up to 15
minutes at a time.<br />
<strong>Hunter’s Lore.</strong> You gain proficiency with two of the
following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.<br />
<strong>Natural Armor.</strong> You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren’t 
wearing armor, your AC is <strong>13 + your Dexterity modifier</strong>. You can 
use your natural armor to determine
your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a
lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you
use your natural armor. <br />
<strong>Hungry Jaws.</strong> In battle, you can throw yourself into a
vicious feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make
a special attack with your bite. If the attack hits, it deals
its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points
(minimum of 1) equal to your Constitution modifier, and
you can’t use this trait again until you finish a short or
long rest.<br />
<strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common
and Draconic</p>
