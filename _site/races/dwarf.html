<strong>Subrace.</strong> Two main subraces of dwarves populate the
worlds of D&amp;D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves.
Choose one of these subraces</p>

<h2 id="hill-dwarf">Hill Dwarf</h2>
<p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition,
and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerun
in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as
are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in
the Dragonlance setting.<br />
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score
increases by 1.<br />
<strong>Dwarven Toughness.</strong> Your hit point maximum
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you
gain a level.</p>

<h2 id="mountain-dwarf">Mountain Dwarf</h2>
<p>As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy,
accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re
probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward
lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern
Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble
Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.<br />
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score
increases by 2.<br />
<strong>Dwarven Armor Training.</strong> You have proficiency with
light and medium armor.</p>

<h2 id="duergar">Duergar</h2>

<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 1.
Superior Darkvision. Your darkvision has a radius
of 120 feet.<br />
<strong>Extra Language.</strong> You can speak, read, and write
Undercommon.<br />
<strong>Duergar Resilience.</strong> You have advantage on saving
throws against illusions and against being charmed or
paralyzed.<br />
<strong>Duergar Magic.</strong> When you reach 3rd level, you can
cast the enlarge/reduce spell on yourself once with this
trait, using only the spell’s enlarge option. When you
reach 5th level, you can cast the invisibility spell on
yourself once with this trait. You don’t need material
components for either spell, and you can’t cast them
while you’re in direct sunlight, although sunlight has no
effect on them once cast. You regain the ability to cast
these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest.
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.<br />
<strong>Sunlight Sensitivity.</strong> You have disadvantage on attack
rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever
you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>
