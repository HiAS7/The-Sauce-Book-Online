<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score
increases by 2, and your Constitution score
increases by 1.<br />
<strong>Age.</strong> Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans,
reaching adulthood around age 14. They age
noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.<br />
<strong>Alignment.</strong> Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos
from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined
toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing
to live out their lives among them are usually evil.<br />
<strong>Size.</strong> Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than
humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall.
Your size is Medium.<br />
<strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br />
<strong>Darkvision.</strong> Thanks to your orc blood, you have
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br />
<strong>Menacing.</strong> You gain proficiency in the
Intimidation skill.<br />
<strong>Relentless Endurance.</strong> When you are reduced to
0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit
point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you
finish a long rest.<br />
<strong>Savage Attacks.</strong> When you score a critical hit with
a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s
damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra
damage of the critical hit.<br />
<strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and
write Common and Orc. Orc is a
harsh, grating language with
hard consonants. It has
no script of its own
but is written in the
Dwarvish script.</p>
