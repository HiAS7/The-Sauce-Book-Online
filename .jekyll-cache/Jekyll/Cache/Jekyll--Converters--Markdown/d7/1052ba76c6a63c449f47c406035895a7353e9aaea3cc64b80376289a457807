<p><strong>Subrace (The beast within)</strong><br />
Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within: a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges over time as the shifterâ€™s personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifterâ€™s personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit is drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.</p>

<p>This beast within is reflected by the shifterâ€™s subrace. Four subraces are especially common:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Beasthide</strong> often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn and thick-skinned.</li>
  <li><strong>Longtooth</strong> shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.</li>
  <li><strong>Swiftstride</strong> are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</li>
  <li><strong>Wildhunt</strong> shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, theyâ€™ll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</p>
