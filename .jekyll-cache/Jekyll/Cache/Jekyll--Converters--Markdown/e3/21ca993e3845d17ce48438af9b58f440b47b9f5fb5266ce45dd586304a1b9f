their equine bodies reaching about 4 feet at the withers.
Your size is Medium.<br />
<strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 40 feet.<br />
<strong>Fey.</strong> Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid.
Charge. If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a
target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the
same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a
bonus action, making one attack against the target with
your hooves.<br />
<strong>Hooves.</strong> Your hooves are natural melee weapons,
which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit
with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to ld4 +
your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.<br />

push or drag.<br />

especially difficult for you because of you r equine legs.

costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.<br />

skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.<br />
<strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common
and Sylvan. Sylvan is widely spoken in the Selesnya
