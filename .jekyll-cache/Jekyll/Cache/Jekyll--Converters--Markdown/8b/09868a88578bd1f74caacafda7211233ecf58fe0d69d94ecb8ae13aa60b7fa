tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers,
scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend
toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers,
or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the 
tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.<br />

clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases
to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour
repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when
you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can
reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up
to three such devices active at a time.
When you create a device, choose one of the
following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clockwork Toy.</strong> This toy is a clockwork animal, monster,
or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or
soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves
5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a
random direction. It makes noises as appropriate
to the creature it represents.</li>
  <li><strong>Fire Starter.</strong> The device produces a miniature
flame, which you can use to light a candle,
torch, or campfire. Using the device
requires your action.</li>
  <li><strong>Music Box.</strong> When opened, this music box
