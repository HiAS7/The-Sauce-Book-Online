the equipment granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(a) a mace or (b) a warhammer (if proficient)</li>
  <li>(a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if

</ul>

<h4 id="spellcasting"><a id="spellcasting-cleric"></a>Spellcasting</h4>
<p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.</p>
<h5 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h5>
<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from
the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Cleric table.</p>
<h5 id="preparing-and-casting-spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>
<p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.<br />
You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. when
you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to
your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of
one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.<br />
For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom
of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells
of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare
the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesnâ€™t
remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
The power of your spells comes from your devotion to
your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ritual-casting">Ritual Casting</h5>
<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h5>
<p>You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>

<h4 id="divine-domain">Divine Domain</h4>
<p>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War.</p>

</ul>

<p>Your choice grants you domain spells and other
features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants
you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you
gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at
6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>
<h5 id="domain-spells">Domain Spells</h5>
<p>Each domain has a list of spellsâ€”its domain spellsâ€”
that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain
description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always
have it prepared, and it doesnâ€™t count against the
number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a domain spell that doesnâ€™t appear on the
cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>
<h4 id="channel-divinity">Channel Divinity</h4>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine
energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel
magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn
Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Som e
dom ains grant you additional effects as you advance in
levels, as noted in the dom ain description.
when you use your Channel Divinity, you choose
which effect to create. You must then finish a short or
long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
when you use such an effect from this class, the DC
equals your cleric spell save DC.
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel
Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level.
you can use it three times between rests. when you finish
a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>
<h5 id="channel-divinity-turn-undead">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>
<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see
or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it canâ€™t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also canâ€™t take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If thereâ€™s nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.</p>
<h4 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h4 id="destroy-undead">Destroy Undead</h4>
<p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving
throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a
certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>

<h4 id="divine-intervention">Divine Intervention</h4>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to
intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
Imploring your deityâ€™s aid requires you to use your
action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll
percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower
than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM
chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any
cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you canâ€™t use this feature
again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after
you finish a long rest.
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds
automatically, no roll required.</p>

<h5 id="blessings-of-knowledge">Blessings of Knowledge</h5>
<p>At 1st level, you learn two languages of your choice.
You also become proficient in your choice of two of the
following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check
you make that uses either of those skills.</p>

<h5 id="channel-divinity--knowledge-of-the-ages">Channel Divinity  Knowledge of the Ages</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action,
you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have
proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.</p>
<h5 id="channel-divinity-read-thoughts">Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a
creatureâ€™s thoughts. You can then use your access to the
creatureâ€™s mind to command it.<br />
As an action, choose one creature that you can see
within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the
saving throw, you canâ€™t use this feature on it again until
you finish a long rest.<br />
If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface
thoughts (those forem ost in its mind, reflecting its
current emotions and what it is actively thinking
about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts
for 1 minute.
During that time, you can use your action to end this
effect and cast the suggestion spell on the creature
without expending a spell slot. The target automatically
fails its saving throw against the spell.</p>
<h5 id="potent-spellcasting">Potent Spellcasting</h5>
<p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to
the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p>
<h5 id="visions-of-the-past">Visions of the Past</h5>
<p>Starting at 17th level, you can call up visions of the
past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate
surroundings.<br />
You spend at least 1 minute in meditation
and prayer, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses
of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a
number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and
must maintain concentration during that time, as if you
were casting a spell.
Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.<br />
<strong>Object Reading.</strong> Holding an object as you meditate,
you can see visions of the objectâ€™s previous owner.
After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner
acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent
significant event involving the object and that owner.
If the object was ow ned by another creature in the
recent past (within a number of days equal to your
Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute
for each owner to learn the same information about
that creature.<br />
<strong>Area Reading.</strong> As you meditate, you see visions
of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room,
street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube),
going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom
score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about
one significant event, beginning with the most recent.
Significant events typically involve powerful emotions,
such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders,
births and funerals. However, they might also include
more mundane events that are nevertheless important
in your current situation.</p>
<h4 id="life-domain">Life Domain</h4>
<p>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive
energyâ€”one of the fundamental forces of the universeâ€”
that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality
and health through healing the sick and wounded,
caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of
death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim
influence over this domain, particularly agricultural
deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun
gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing
or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht),
and gods of home and
community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).</p>
