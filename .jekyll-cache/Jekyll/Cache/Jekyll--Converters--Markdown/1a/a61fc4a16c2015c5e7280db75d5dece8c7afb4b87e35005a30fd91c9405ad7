  <li><strong>Commander‚Äôs Strike.</strong> When you take the Attack
action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks

melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one
superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you
roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver
before or after making the attack roll, but before any
effects of the attack are applied.</li>
  <li><strong>Pushing Attack.</strong> When you hit a creature with
a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority
die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the

melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority
die to attempt to damage another creature with the
same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet
of the original target and within your reach. If the
original attack roll would hit the second creature, it
takes damage equal to the number you roll on your
superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by
the original attack.</li>
  <li><strong>Trip Attack.</strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon
attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt
to knock the target down. You add the superiority die

    <h5 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h5>
    <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial
prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10
for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for
the wizard spell list.<br />
<strong>Cantrips.</strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from
the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard
cantrip of your choice at 10th level.<br />
<strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table
shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell‚Äôs level or
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.<br />
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and
have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you
can cast shield using either slot.
<strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</strong> You know
three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
you must choose from the abjuration and evocation
spells on the wizard spell list.<br />
The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight
Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard
spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be
an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must
be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance,
when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one
new spell of 1st or 2nd level.<br />
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can
come from any school of magic.<br />
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can
replace one of the wizard spells you know with another
spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The
new spell must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell,
unless you‚Äôre replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,
or 20th level.<br />
<strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> <strong>Intelligence</strong> is your spellcasting
ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your
spells through study and memorization. You use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you
cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="weapon-bond">Weapon Bond</h5>
<p>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical
bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform
the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done
during a short rest. The weapon must be within your
reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which
you touch the weapon and forge the bond.<br />
Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you
can‚Äôt be disarm ed of that weapon unless you are
incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence,
you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your
turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can
summon only one at a time with your bonus action.<br />
If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must
break the bond with one of the other two.</p>
<h5 id="war-magic">War Magic</h5>

creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw
it makes against a spell you cast before the end of
your next turn.</p>
<h5 id="arcane-charge">Arcane Charge</h5>
<p>At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30
feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use

<p>At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the
secrets of nature‚Äîtypical for practitioners of this elven
martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in ei‚Äî
ther the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to
learn either the prestidigr‚Äôtation or the drufdcraft cantrip.</p>
<h5 id="arcane-shot">ARCANE SHOT</h5>
<p>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects
with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you
learn two <a href="#arcane-shot-options">Arcane Shot options</a> of your choice.<br />
Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a
shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you
can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that ar‚Äî
row. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits
a creature, unless the option doesn‚Äôt involve an attack
roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all
expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your
choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th,
10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves
when you become an 18th‚Äîlevel fighter.</p>
<h5 id="magic-arrow">MAGIC ARROW</h5>
<p>At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with
magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a
shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and 
damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses 
its target.</p>
<h5 id="curving-shot">CURVING SHOT</h5>
<p>At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow
toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with
a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to
reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60
feet of the original target.</p>
<h5 id="ever-ready-shot">EVER-READY SHOT</h5>
<p>Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available
whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no
uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.</p>
<h5 id="arcane-shot-options">ARCANE SHOT OPTIONS</h5>
<p>The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at
certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They 
are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the 
schools of magic.<br />
If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot
save DC equals</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Banishing Arrow.</strong> You use abjuration magic to try to
temporarily banish your target to a harmless location
in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also
succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.<br />
While banished in this way, the target‚Äôs speed is 0, and
it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target
reappears in the Space it vacated or in the nearest unoc- cupied space if that space is occupied.<br />
After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also
takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.<br />
<strong>Beguiling Arrow.</strong> Your enchantment magic causes
this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature
hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and
choose one ofyour allies within 30 feet of the target.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or
it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your
next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally at‚Äî
tacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it
to make a saving throw.<br />
The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach
18th level in this class.<br />
<strong>Bursting Arrow.</strong> You imbue your arrow with force
energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy
detonates after your attack. Immediately after the ar‚Äî
row hits the creature, the target and all other creatures
within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.<br />
The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach
18th level in this class.<br />
<strong>Enfeeblfng Arrow.</strong> You weave necromantic magic into
your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra
2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed
on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt
by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your
next turn.<br />
The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach
18th level in this class.<br />
<strong>Grasping Arrow.</strong> When this arrow strikes its target,
conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brams
bles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by
the arrow takes an extra 2(16 poison damage, its speed
is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on 
each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any 
creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with
a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. 
Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option 
again.<br />
The poison damage and slashing damage both in- crease to 4d6 when you 
reach 18th level in this class.<br />
<strong>Piercing Arrow.</strong> You use transmutation magic to
give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this
option, you don‚Äôt make an attack roll for the attack.
Instead, the arrow shoots forward in a line, which is 1
foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The
arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring
cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage
as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing
damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.<br />
The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach
18th level in this class.<br />
<strong>Seeking Arrow.</strong> Using divination magic, you grant
your arrow the ability to seek out a target. When you use
this option, you don‚Äôt make an attack roll for the attack.
Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past
minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving
around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters
cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon‚Äôs
range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to
travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity
saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after
traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target
takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra
1d6 force damage, and you learn the target‚Äôs current
location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and 
you don‚Äôt learn its location.<br />
The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach
18th level in this class.<br />
<strong>Shadow Arrow.</strong> You weave illusion magic into your
arrow, causing it to occlude your fees vision with shadows. The creature 
hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6
psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5
feet away until the start of your next turn.<br />
The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach
18th level in this class.</p>

Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of
your choice.</p>
<h5 id="born-to-the-saddle">BORN TO THE SADDLE</h5>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes
apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made
to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount
and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your
feet if you‚Äôre not incapacitated.<br />
Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you
only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</p>
<h5 id="unwavering-mark">UNWAVERING MARK</h5>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foe-s, foiling
their attacks and punishing them for harming others.
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack,
you can mark the creature until the end of your next
turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or
you die, or if someone else marks the creature.<br />
While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by
you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn‚Äôt
target you.<br />
In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage
to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee
weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus
action on your next turn. You have advantage on the
attack roll, and if it hits, the attacks weapon deals extra
damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.
Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you
can make this special attack a number of times equal to
your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you re- gain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h5 id="warding-maneuver">WARDING MANEUVER</h5>
<p>At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at
you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can 
see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a 
reaction if you‚Äôre wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and 
add the number rolled to the target‚Äôs AC against that attack. If
the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the
attack‚Äôs damage.<br />
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and
you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a
long rest.</p>
<h5 id="hold-the-line">HOLD THE LINE</h5>
<p>At 10th level, you become a master of locking down
your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack
from you when they move 5 feet or more while within
your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity
attack, the target‚Äôs speed is reduced to 0 until the end of
the current turn.</p>

<h5 id="ferocious-charger">FEROCIOUS CHARGER</h5>
<p>Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes,
whether you‚Äôre mounted or not. If you move at least 10
feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature
and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed
on a Strength saving throw (DC <strong>8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier</strong>) or be knocked prone.<br />
You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.</p>
<h5 id="vigilant-defender">VIGILANT DEFENDER</h5>
<p>Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with
extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special
reaction that you can take once on every creature‚Äôs turn,
except your turn. You can use this special reaction only
to make an opportunity attack, and you can‚Äôt use it on
the same turn that you take your normal reaction.</p>

<h4 id="samurai">Samurai</h4>
<h5 id="bonus-proficiency-1">BONUS PROFICIENCY</h5>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice:
History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alterna‚Äî
tively, you learn one language of your choice.</p>
<h5 id="fighting-spirit">FIGHTING SPIRIT</h5>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield
you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on your
turn, you can give yourself advantage on weapon attack
rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so,
you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of
temporary hit points increases when you reach certain
levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15
at 15th level.<br />
You can use this feature three times, and you regain
all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h5 id="elegant-courtier">ELEGANT COURTIER</h5>
<p>Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to de‚Äî
tail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you
make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus
to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier. Your self-control also causes 
you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this 
proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma 
saving throws (your choice).</p>
<h5 id="tireless-spirit">TIRELESS SPIRIT</h5>
<p>Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and
have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.</p>
<h5 id="rapid-strike">RAPID STRIKE</h5>
<p>Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for
swift strikes. If you take the Attack action on your turn
and have advantage on an attack roll against one of
the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to
make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. <br />
You can do so no more than once per turn.</p>
<h5 id="strength-before-death">STRENGTH BEFORE DEATH</h5>
<p>Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the
grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to
0 hit points and doesn‚Äôt kill you outright, you can use
your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can
immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current
turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn,
taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three 
death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, 
you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.<br />
Once you use this feature, you can‚Äôt use it again until
you finish a long rest.</p>
