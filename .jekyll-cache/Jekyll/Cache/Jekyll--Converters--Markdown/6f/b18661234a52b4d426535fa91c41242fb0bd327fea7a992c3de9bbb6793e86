<h4 id="spellcasting"><a id="spellcasting-sorcerer"></a>Spellcasting</h4>
<p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or
ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with
arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin,
fuels your spells.</p>
<h5 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h5>
<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from
the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p>
<h5 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h5>
<p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast
one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell
slots when you finish a long rest.<br />
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning
hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p>
<h5 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the
sorcerer spell list.<br />
The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table
shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your
choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd
level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st
or 2nd level.<br />
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
<p><strong>Charisma</strong> is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer
spells, since the power of your magic relies on your
ability to project your will into the world. You use your
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell
you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier</p>
  <h5 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h5>
  <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for 
your sorcerer spells.</p>

1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>
<h4 id="font-of-magic">Font of Magic</h4>

within yourself. This wellspring is represented by
sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of
magical effects.</p>
<h4 id="sorcery-points">Sorcery Points</h4>
<p>You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you

level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you
finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="flexible-casting">Flexible Casting</h4>
<p>You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell
slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery
points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points
as you reach higher levels.<br />

sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on
your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table show s the cost

<p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells
to suit your needs. You gain two of the following
Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one
at 10th and 17th level.<br />
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell
when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<h5 id="careful-spell">Careful Spell</h5>
<p>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make
a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures
from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery
point and choose a number of those creatures up to your
Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen
creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw
against the spell.</p>
<h5 id="distant-spell">Distant Spell</h5>
<p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or
greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the
range of the spell.<br />

You can use Em powered Spell even if you have
already used a different Metamagic option during the
casting of the spell.</p>
<h5 id="extended-spell">Extended Spell</h5>

you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting
time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>
<h5 id="subtle-spell">Subtle Spell</h5>
<p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
cast it without any som atic or verbal components.</p>
<h5 id="twinned-spell">Twinned Spell</h5>

doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of
sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second
creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if
the spell is a cantrip).</p>
<h4 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your

score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h4 id="sorcerous-restoration">Sorcerous Restoration</h4>
<p>At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points
whenever you finish a short rest.</p>

<h3 id="sorcerous-origins">Sorcerous Origins</h3>

<h4 id="draconic-bloodline">Draconic Bloodline</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was
mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most
often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent
back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a
bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed
a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well
established in the world, but most are obscure. Any
given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a
result of a pact or some other exceptional circum stance.</p>
<h5 id="dragon-ancestor">Dragon Ancestor</h5>
<p>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your
ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon
is used by features you gain later.
Dragon |Damage Type</p>
<ul>
  <li>|-
Black |Acid
Blue |Lightning
Brass| Fire
Bronze| Lightning
Copper| Acid
Cold |Fire
Green| Poison
Red |Fire
Silver| Cold
White |Cold
You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally,
whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting
with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it
applies to the check.
    <h5 id="draconic-resilience">Draconic Resilience</h5>
    <p>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical
traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level,
your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by
1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin
sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing
armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
    <h5 id="elemental-affinity">Elemental Affinity</h5>
    <p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals
damage of the type associated with your draconic
ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage.
At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain
resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.</p>
    <h5 id="dragon-wings">Dragon Wings</h5>
    <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of
dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed
equal to your current speed. You can create these wings
as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you
dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.<br />
You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor
unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and
clothing not made to accommodate your wings might
be destroyed when you manifest them.</p>
    <h5 id="draconic-presence">Draconic Presence</h5>
    <p>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread
presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around
you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action,
you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power
and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a
distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your
concentration (as if you were casting a concentration
spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this
aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose
fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on
this saving throw is im mune to your aura for 24 hours.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="wild-magic">Wild Magic</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos
that underlie the order of creation. You might have
endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps
through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental
Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you
were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a
demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with
no apparent cause or reason. However it cam e to be, this
chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p>
<h5 id="wild-magic-surge">Wild Magic Surge</h5>
<p>Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your
spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic.
Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level
or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a
1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random
magical effect.
<img src="WildMagicTable.PNG" alt="Wild Magic Table" /></p>
<h5 id="tides-of-chaos">Tides of Chaos</h5>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of
chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must
finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the
DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table
immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or
higher. You then regain the use of this feature.</p>
<h5 id="bend-luck">Bend Luck</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate
using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes 
an <strong>attack roll</strong>, <strong>an ability check</strong>, or a <strong>saving throw</strong>, 
you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery
points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a
bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You
can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects
of the roll occur.</p>

<h4 id="divine-soul">Divine Soul</h4>

<h5 id="divine-magic">DIVINE MAGIC</h5>
<p>Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from
the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you
learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of
1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from
the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must
otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the
spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.<br />
In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your
divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You
learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown
below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count
against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you
later replace this spell, you must replace it with a Spell
from the cleric spell list.
Affinity |Spell</p>
<ul>
  <li>|-
Good |cure wounds
Evil |inflict wounds
Law |bless
Chaos |bone
Neutrality |protectionfrom evil and good

turn.</p>

sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.</p>
<h5 id="strength-of-the-grave">STRENGTH OF THE GRAVE</h5>

a monstrosity, not a beast.</li>
  <li>It appears with a number of temporary hit points
equal to half your sorcerer level.</li>
  <li>It can move through other creatures and objects as
if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force
damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
  <li>At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows
its target’s location. If the target was hidden, it is no
longer hidden from the hound.</li>
</ul>

choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the
hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by
the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its 
target. The hound can make opportunity attacks,
but only against its target. <br />

has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound
disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is
reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.</p>

<p>At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder
damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell

(choose each time this ability activates) equal to half
your sorcerer level.</p>
