<strong>Age.</strong> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but
they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50.
On average, they live about 350 years. <br />
<strong>Alignment.</strong> Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly
in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend
toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and
a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of
a just order. <br />
<strong>Size.</strong> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and
average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.<br />
<strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your
speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.<br />
<strong>Darkvision.</strong> Accustomed to life underground, you
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br />

are considered proficient in the History skill and add
double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of
your normal proficiency bonus.<br />

guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into
whatever other language a dwarf might speak.<br />
<strong>Subrace.</strong> Two main subraces of dwarves populate the
worlds of D&amp;D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves.
Choose one of these subraces</p>

<h2 id="hill-dwarf">Hill Dwarf</h2>
<p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition,

the Dragonlance setting.<br />

<h2 id="mountain-dwarf">Mountain Dwarf</h2>
<p>As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy,
accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re
probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward
lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern
Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble
Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.<br />

cast the enlarge/reduce spell on yourself once with this
trait, using only the spell’s enlarge option. When you
reach 5th level, you can cast the invisibility spell on
yourself once with this trait. You don’t need material
components for either spell, and you can’t cast them
while you’re in direct sunlight, although sunlight has no
effect on them once cast. You regain the ability to cast
these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest.
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.<br />
<strong>Sunlight Sensitivity.</strong> You have disadvantage on attack
rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever
you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>
