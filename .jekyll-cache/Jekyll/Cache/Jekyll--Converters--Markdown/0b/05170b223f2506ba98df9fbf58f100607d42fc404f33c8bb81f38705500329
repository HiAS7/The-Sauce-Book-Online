do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They
live much longer than humans, however, often
exceeding 180 years.<br />
<strong>Alignment.</strong> Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their
elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and
creative expression, demonstrating neither love
of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at
rules, resent othersâ€™ demands, and sometimes prove
unreliable, or at least unpredictable.<br />

ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.<br />

<strong>Darkvision.</strong> Thanks to your elf blood, you have
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can

discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br />

against being charmed, and magic canâ€™t put you to sleep.<br />
