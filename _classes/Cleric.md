#### <a id="spellcasting-cleric"></a>Spellcasting
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.
##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from
the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Cleric table.
##### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.<br/>
You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. when
you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to
your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of
one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.<br/>
For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom
of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells
of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare
the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
##### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
The power of your spells comes from your devotion to
your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier<br/>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier

##### Ritual Casting
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

#### Divine Domain
Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. 
* [Knowledge Domain](#knowledge-domain)
* [Life Domain](#life-domain)
* [Light Domain](#light-domain)
* [Nature Domain](#nature-domain)
* [Tempest Domain](#tempest-domain)
* [Trickery Domain](#trickery-domain)
* [War Domain](#war-domain)
* [Forge Domain](#forge-domain)
* [Grave Domain](#grave-domain)

Your choice grants you domain spells and other
features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants
you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you
gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at
6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
##### Domain Spells
Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—
that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain
description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always
have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the
number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the
cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
#### Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine
energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel
magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn
Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Som e
dom ains grant you additional effects as you advance in
levels, as noted in the dom ain description.
when you use your Channel Divinity, you choose
which effect to create. You must then finish a short or
long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
when you use such an effect from this class, the DC
equals your cleric spell save DC.
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel
Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level.
you can use it three times between rests. when you finish
a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
##### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see
or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.
#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
#### Destroy Undead
Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving
throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a
certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

Cleric Level| Destroys Undead of CR
------------|----------------------
5th         |1/2 or lower
8th         |1 or lower
11th        |2 or lower
14th        |3 or lower
17th        |4 or lower

#### Divine Intervention
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to
intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your
action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll
percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower
than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM
chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any
cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature
again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after
you finish a long rest.
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds
automatically, no roll required.

At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a
creature’s thoughts. You can then use your access to the
creature’s mind to command it.<br/>
As an action, choose one creature that you can see
within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the
saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until
you finish a long rest.<br/>
If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface
thoughts (those forem ost in its mind, reflecting its
current emotions and what it is actively thinking
about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts
for 1 minute.
During that time, you can use your action to end this
effect and cast the suggestion spell on the creature
without expending a spell slot. The target automatically
fails its saving throw against the spell.

number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and
must maintain concentration during that time, as if you
were casting a spell.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.<br/>

you can see visions of the object’s previous owner.
After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner
acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent
significant event involving the object and that owner.

for each owner to learn the same information about
that creature.<br/>
**Area Reading.** As you meditate, you see visions
of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room,
street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube),
going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom
score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about
one significant event, beginning with the most recent.
Significant events typically involve powerful emotions,
such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders,
births and funerals. However, they might also include
more mundane events that are nevertheless important
in your current situation.
#### Life Domain
The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive
energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—
that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality
and health through healing the sick and wounded,
caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of
death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim
influence over this domain, particularly agricultural
deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun
gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing
or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht),
and gods of home and
community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay
out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal
to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and
transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even 
nonmetal parts of the creation.<br/>
The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item
that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the
original during the ritual.

##### CIRCLE OF MORTALITY
At 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate the line
between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to
a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest
number possible for each die.<br/>
In addition, you learn the spare the dying cantrip,
which doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and
you can cast it as a bonus action.
##### EYES OF THE GRAVE

presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to
the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your
awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end
of your next turn, you know the location of any undead
within 60 feet of you that isn’t behind total cover and
that isn’t protected from divination magic. This sense
doesn’t tell you anything about a creature's capabilities or identity.<br/>

your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain
all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
##### CHANNEL DIVINITY: PATH TO THE GRAVE

to mark another creature’s life force for termination.
As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, 
cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally 
of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has
vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the
curse ends.
##### SENTINEL AT DEATH’S DOOR
At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a 
reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers 
a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects 
triggered by a critical hit are canceled.<br/>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to
your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain
all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to
the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
##### KEEPER OF SOULS
Starting at 17th level. you can seize a trace of vitality
from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When
an enemy you can see dies within 60 feet of you, you or one creature of 
your choice that is within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to the 
enemy’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren’t 
incapacitated. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the
start of your next turn.
