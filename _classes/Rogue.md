* (a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an

#### <a id="expertise-rogue"></a>Expertise
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or
one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with
thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
ability check you make that uses either of the chosen
proficiencies.<br/>
At 6th level, you can choose two more of your
proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain
this benefit.
#### Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you knowhow to strike subtly
and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can
deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with
an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The
attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.<br/>
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another
enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on
the attack roll.<br/>
The amount of the extra damage increases as you
gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack
column of the Rogue table.
#### Thieves’ Cant
During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a
secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to
hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only
another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands
such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such
a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.<br/>
In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and
symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such
as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a
thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the
people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe
house for thieves on the run.
#### Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility
allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a
bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This
action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage,
or Hide action.
#### Roguish Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate
in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin,
or Arcane Trickster, 
* [Thief](#thief)
* [Assassin](#assassin)
* [Arcane Trickster](#arcane-trickster)
* [Inquisitive](#inquisitive)
* [Mastermind](#mastermind)
* [Scout](#scout)
* [Swashbuckler](#swashbuckler)

Your archetype choice grants you features
at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score
of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase
an ability score above 20 using this feature.
#### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to
halve the attack’s damage against you.
#### <a id="evasion-rogue"></a>Evasion
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the
way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery
breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected
to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only
half damage if you fail.
#### Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until
they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability
check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can
treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
#### Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are
aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature
within 10 feet of you.
#### Slippery Mind
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental
strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
#### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that
attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No
attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t
incapacitated.
#### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding
when you need to. If your attack misses a target within
range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if
you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.

### Roguish Archetypes
#### Thief
##### Fast Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action
granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to
disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an
Object action.
##### Second-Story Work
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
the ability to climb faster than normal; clim bing no
longer costs you extra movement.
In addition, when you make a running jump, the
distance you cover increases by a num ber of feet equal
to your Dexterity modifier.
##### Supreme Sneak
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity
(Stealth) check if you move no more than half your
speed on the same turn.
##### Use Magic Device
By 13th level, you have learned enough about the
workings of magic that you can im provise the use of
items even when they are not intended for you. You
ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use
of magic items.
##### Thief’s Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at
laying am bushes and quickly escaping danger. You can
take two turns during the first round of any combat. You
take your first turn at your normal initiative and your
second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use
this feature when you are surprised.
#### Assassin
##### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit.
##### Assassinate
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you
get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on
attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn
in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against
a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
##### Infiltration Expertise
Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false
identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and
25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations
for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that
belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire
appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and officiallooking certification to establish yourself as a member of
a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate
yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.
Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise,
other creatures believe you to be that person until given
an obvious reason not to.
##### Impostor
At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic
another person’s speech, writing, and behavior.
You must spend at least three hours studying
these three components of the person’s behavior,
listening to speech, exam ining handwriting, and
observing mannerisms.<br/>
Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a
wary creature suspects something is am iss, you have
advantage on any Charisma (D eception) check you make
to avoid detection.
##### Death Strike
Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant
death. When you attack and hit a creature that is
surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw
(DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency
bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your
attack against the creature.

##### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to
cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.<br/>
**Cantrips.** You learn three cantrips: mage hand and
two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell
list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice
at 10th level.<br/>
**Spell Slots.** The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting
table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.<br/>
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm
person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast charm person using either slot.
Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. You know
three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
you must choose from the enchantment and illusion
spells on the wizard spell list.<br/>
The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster
Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard
spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must
be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For
instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can
learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.<br/>
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can
come from any school of magic.<br/>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can
replace one of the wizard spells you know with another
spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The
new spell must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell,
unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,
or 20th level.<br/>
**Spellcasting Ability.** **Intelligence** is your spellcasting
ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your
spells through dedicated study and memorization.<br/>
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to
your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
>**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier<br/>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

#### Inquisitive

##### EAR FOR DEGEIT
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you de—
velop a talent for picking out lies. Whenever you make a
Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature
is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.

##### EYE FOR DETAIL
Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to make
a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature
or object or to make an Intelligence (Investigation)
l check to uncover or decipher clues.
##### INSIGHTFUL FIGHTING
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent's tactics and 
develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you can make a Wisdom 
(Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn’t incapacitated, 
contested by the target’s Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you 
can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don’t have 
advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.<br/>
This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this 
feature against a different target.
##### STEADY EYE
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on any Wisdom
(Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you move no more 
than half your speed on the same turn.
##### UNERRING EYE
Beginning at 13th level, your senses are almost im«
possible to foil. As an action, you sense the presence
of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form,
and other magic designed to deceive the senses within
30 feet of you, provided you aren’t blinded or deafened.
You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you,
but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its
true nature.<br/>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to
your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you re- gain all expended 
uses of it when you finish a long rest.
##### EYE FOR WEAKNESS
At 17th level, you learn to exploit a creature’s weak—
nesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement.
While your Insightful Fighting feature applies to a creature, your Sneak Attack damage against that creature
increases by 3d6.

#### Mastermind

##### MASTER OF INTRIGUE
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one
gaming set Of your choice. You also learn two languages
of your choice.<br/>

patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak
for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native 
speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.
##### MASTER OF TACTICS
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a
bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action
to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that
attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5
feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.
##### INSIGHTFUL MANIPULATOR
Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute
observing or interacting with another creature outside
combat, you can learn certain information about its ca—
pabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the
creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to
two of the following characteristics of your choice: - Intelligence score
* Wisdom score
* Charisma score
* Class levels (if any)

At the DM’s option, you might also realize you know a
piece of the creature’s history or one of its personality
traits, if it has any.
##### MISDIRECTION
Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause an- other creature to 
suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while 
a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack,
you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead 
of you.
##### SOUL OF DECEIT
Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can’t be read by
telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can
present false thoughts by succeeding on a Charisma
(Deception) check contested by the mind reader’s Wis—
dom (Insight) check.<br/>
Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would
determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can’t be compelled to tell the truth by magic.

#### Scout 

##### SKIRMISHER
Starting at 3rd level, you are difficult to pin down during
a fight. You can move up to half your speed as a reaction
when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This
movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
##### SURVIVALIST
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency in the Nature and Survival skills if you don’t
already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for
any ability check you make that uses either of those pro—
ficiencies.
##### SUPERIOR MOBILITY
At 9th level, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. If
you have a climbing or swimming speed, this increase
applies to that speed as well.
##### AMBUSH MASTER
Starting at 13th level, you excel at leading ambushes
and acting first in a fight.<br/>
You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the
first creature you hit during the first round of a combat
becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls
against that target have advantage until the start of your
next turn.
##### SUDDEN STRIKE
Starting at 17th level, you can strike with deadly speed.
If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make
one additional attack as a bonus action. This attack can
benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already
used it this turn, but you can’t use your Sneak Attack
against the same target more than once in a turn.

#### Swashbuckler

##### FANCY FOOTWORK
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn
how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal.
During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a
creature, that creature can’t make opportunity attacks
against you for the rest ofyour turn.
##### RAKISH AUDACITY
Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into
battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative
rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. You also gain an additional way to 
use your Sneak Attack; you don’t need advantage on the attack roll to use
your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5
feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and
you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the
other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.
##### PANACHE
At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, 
you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check 
contested by a creature’s Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be 
able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.
If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile
to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than 
you and can’t make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. <br/>
This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the 
target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more 
than 60 feet apart.<br/>
If you succeed on the check and the creature isn’t
hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While
charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This
effect ends immediately if you or your companions do
anything harmful to it.
##### ELEGANT MANEUVER
Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on
your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Ac—
robatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during
the same turn.
##### MASTER DUELIST
Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets
you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with
an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once
you do so, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short orlong rest.
