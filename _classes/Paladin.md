* (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon
* (a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
* Chain mail and a holy symbol

#### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like
a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly
music in your ears. As an action, you can open your
awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend,
or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total
cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of
any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity
(the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).
Within the same radius, you also detect the presence
of any place or object that has been consecrated or
desecrated, as with the hallow spell.<br/>
You can use this feature a num ber of times equal to
1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest,
you regain all expended uses.
#### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool
of healing power that replenishes when you take a long
rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of
hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.<br/>
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw
power from the pool to restore a num ber of hit points
to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining
in your pool.<br/>
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your
pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or
neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple
diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single
use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately
for each one.<br/>
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
#### <a id="fighting-style-paladin"></a>Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your
specialty. Choose one of the follow ing options. You can’t
take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.
##### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
##### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and
no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
with that weapon.
##### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile
property for you to gain this benefit.
##### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other
than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your
reaction to im pose disadvantage on the attack roll.
You must be wielding a shield.
#### <a id="spellcasting-paladin"></a>Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine
magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as
a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.
##### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of
1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
you finish a long rest.<br/>
You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list.
When you do so, ch oose a num ber of paladin spells equal 
to your **Charisma modifier + half your paladin level**, 
rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a
Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include
four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you
prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast
it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin
spells, since their power derives from the strength of
your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you
use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making
an attack roll with one.
>**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier<br/>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

#### Divine Smite
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a
melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell
slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to
the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a
1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher
than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases
by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.
#### Divine Health
By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you
m akes you im mune to disease.
#### Sacred Oath
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds
you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been
in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not
yet sworn to it.
* [Oath of Devotion](#oath-of-devotion)
* [Oath of the Ancients](#oath-of-the-ancients)
* [Oath of Vengeance](#oath-of-vengeance)
* [Oath of Conquest](#oath-of-conquest)
* [Oath of Redemption](#oath-of-redemption)

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again
at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. T hose features include oath
spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
##### Oath Spells
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain
access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath
description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you
always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against
the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the
paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin
spell for you.
##### Channel Divinity
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel
magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided
by your oath explains how to use it.
When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose
which option to use. You must then finish a short or long
rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
S om e Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
When you use such an effect from this class, the DC
equals your paladin spell save DC.
#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
#### Aura of Protection
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature
within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the
creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your
Charisma modifier (with a minim um bonus of +1). You
must be conscious to grant this bonus.<br/>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
#### Aura of Courage
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures
within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you
are conscious.<br/>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
#### Improved Divine Smite
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous
might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine
power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a
melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant
damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an
attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your
Divine Smite.
#### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to
end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature
that you touch.<br/>
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma modifier (a minim um of once). You
regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Sacred Oaths

#### Oath of Devotion

##### Tenets of Devotion
Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of
Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.<br/>
**Honesty.** Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be
your promise.<br/>
**Courage.** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.<br/>
**Compassion.** Aid others, protect the weak, and
punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your
foes, but temper it with wisdom.<br/>
**Honor.** Treat others with fairness, and let your
honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as
much good as possible while causing the least
amount of harm.<br/>
**Duty.** Be responsible for your actions and their
consequences, protect those entrusted to your care,
and obey those who have just authority over you.

##### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Paladin Level |Spells
-|-
3rd |protection from evil and good, sanctuary
5th |lesser restoration, zone of truth
9th |beacon of hope, dispel magic
13th |freedom of movement, guardian of faith
17th |commune, flame strike

##### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the
following two Channel Divinity options.<br/>
**Sacred Weapon.** As an action, you can imbue one
weapon that you are holding with positive energy,
using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add
your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that
weapon (with a minimumbonus of +1). The weapon also
emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20
feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it
becomes magical for the duration.<br/>
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any
other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying
this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
**Turn the Unholy.** As an action, you present your
holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and
undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or
undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature
fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until
it takes damage.<br/>
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take 
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action

##### Aura of Devotion
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within
10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
##### Purity of Spirit
Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects
of a protection from evil and good spell.
##### Holy Nimbus
At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of
sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a
30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.<br/>
Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the
bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.<br/>
In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on
saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.<br/>
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.

#### Oath of the Ancients

##### Tenets of the Ancients
The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been
preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath
emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns
of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.<br/>
**Kindle the Light.** Through your acts of mercy,
kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the
world, beating back despair.<br/>
**Shelter the Light.** Where there is good, beauty, love,
and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness
that would sw allow it. Where life flourishes, stand
against the forces that would render it barren.<br/>
**P reserve Your Own Light.** Delight in song and
laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in
your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.<br/>
**Be the Light.** Be a glorious beacon for all who live in
despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth
in all your deeds.

##### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
Paladin Level |Spells
-|-
3rd |ensnaring strike, speak with animals
5th |moonbeam, misty step
9th |plant growth, protection from energy
13th |ice storm, stoneskin
17th |commune with nature, tree stride

##### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the
following two Channel Divinity options.<br/>
**Nature’s Wrath.** You can use your Channel Divinity
to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action,
you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach
for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see.
The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity
saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While
restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it
frees itself and the vines vanish.<br/>
**Turn the Faithless.** You can use your Channel
Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey
and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that
can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it
takes damage.<br/>
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.<br/>
If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion,
shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while
it is turned.
##### Aura of Warding
Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily
upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly
creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to
damage from spells.<br/>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
##### Undying Sentinel
Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit
points and are not killed outright, you can choose to
drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you
can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old
age, and you can’t be aged magically.
##### Elder Champion
At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient
force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose.
For example, your skin might turn green or take on a
bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or mosslike, 
or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.
Using your action, you undergo a transformation.
For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
* At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit
points.
* Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting
time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action
instead.
* Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and
Channel Divinity options.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.

#### Oath of Vengeance

##### Tenets of Vengeance
The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but
all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by
any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets
are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to
mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins
are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The
core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.<br/>
**Fight the Greater Evil.** Faced with a choice of fighting
my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the
greater evil.<br/>
**No Mercy for the Wicked.** Ordinary foes might win
my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.<br/>
**By Any Means Necessary.** My qualms can’t get in the
way of exterminating my foes.<br/>
**Restitution.** If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is
because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed
by their misdeeds.

##### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
Paladin |Level Spells
-|-
3rd |bane, hunter’s mark
5th |hold person, misty step
9th |haste, protection from energy
13th |banishment, dimension door
17th |hold monster, scrying

##### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the
following two Channel Divinity options.<br/>
**Abjure Enemy.** As an action, you present your holy
symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your
Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet
of you that you can see. That creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being
frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on
this saving throw.<br/>
On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1
minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened,
the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any
bonus to its speed.<br/>
On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved
for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
**Vow of Enmity.** As a bonus action, you can utter a vow
of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet
of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage
on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until
it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.
##### Relentless Avenger
By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close
off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an
opportunity attack, you can move up to half your
speed immediately after the attack and as part of
the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks.
##### Soul of Vengeance
Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you
speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over
your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow
of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to
make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is
within range.
##### Avenging Angel
At 20th level, you can assume the form of an
angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a
transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following
benefits:
* Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying
speed of 60 feet.
* You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius.
The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or
starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 
minute or until it takes any damage.<br/>
Attack rolls against the frightened creature have
advantage.<br/>
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.

#### Oath of Conquest
##### TENETS OF CONQUEST
A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest
seared on the upper arm. <br/>
**Douse the Flame of Hope.** It is not enough to merely
defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that 
your enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a 
life. Fear can end an empire.<br/>
**Rule with an Iron Fist.** Once you have conquered,
tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be 
favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who 
might follow.<br/>
**Strength Above All.** You shall rule until a stronger one arises. 
Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own 
ruin.

##### OATH SPELLS
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the
Oath of Conquest Spells table. See the Sacred Oath
class feature for how oath spells work.
Paladin Level |Spells
-|-
3rd |armor onathys, command
5th |hold person, spiritual weapon
9th |bestow curse, fear
13th |dominate beast, stoneskin
17th |cloudkill, dominate person
##### CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the follow—
ing two Channel Divinity options.<br/>
**Conquering Presence.** You can use your Channel
Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action,
you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet 
of you to make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you
for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.<br/>
**Guided Strike.** You can use your Channel Divinity to
strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a
+10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see
the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.
##### AURA OF CONQUEST
Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing
aura while you’re not incapacitated. The aura extends
10 feet from you in every direction, but not through
total cover.<br/>
If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced
to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic
damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its
turn there.<br/>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases
to 30 feet.
##### SCORNFUL REBUKE
Starting at 15th level, those who dare to strike you are
psychically punished for their audacity. Whenever a
creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes
psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if 
you’re not incapacitated.
##### INVINCIBLE CONQUEROR
At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically
become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following
benefits for 1 minute: 
* You have resistance to all damage. 
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action. 
* Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a
roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.

#### Oath of Redemption

##### TENETS or REDEMPTION
The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a
high standard of peace and justice.<br/>
**Peace.** Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy
and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.<br/>
**Innocence.** All people begin life in an innocent state,
and it is their environment or the influence of dark
forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper
example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply
flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.<br/>
**Patience.** Change takes time. Those who have walked
the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep
them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of
righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day
to allow that seed to survive and flourish.<br/>
**Wisdom.** Your heart and mind must stay clear, for
eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can 
be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no 
choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action 
must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but 
once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your 
path is just.

##### OATH SPELLS
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the
Oath of Redemption Spells table. See the Sacred Oath
class feature for how oath spells work.
Paladin Level |Spells
-|-
3rd |sanctuary, sleep
5th |calm emotions, hold person
9th |counterspell, hypnotic pattern
13th |Otiluke’s resilient sphere, stoneskin
17th |hold monster, wall of force
##### CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the follow—
ing two Channel Divinity options.<br/>
**Emissary of Peace.** You can use your Channel Divinity to augment your presence with divine power. As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the next 10 minutes.<br/>
**Rebuke the Violent.** You can use your Channel Divin—
ity to rebuke those who use violence. Immediately after
an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an
attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to 
force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the 
attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a 
successful save, it takes half as much damage.
##### AURA OF THE GUARDIAN
Starting at 7th level, you can shield others from harm at
the cost of your own health. When a creature within 10
feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to
magically take that damage, instead of that creature taking it. This 
feature doesn't transfer any other effects that
might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.<br/>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases
to 30 feet.
##### PROTECTIVE SPIRIT
Starting at 15th level, a holy presence mends your
wounds in battle. You regain hit points equal to 1d6 +
half your paladin level if you end your turn in combat
with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and
you aren't incapacitated.
##### EMISSARY OF REDEMPTION
At 20th level, you become an avatar of peace, which
gives you two benefits: 
* You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures (their attacks, spells, and other effects). 
* Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes
radiant damage equal to half the damage you take
from the attack.

If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit
works against that creature until you finish a long rest.
