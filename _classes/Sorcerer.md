#### <a id="spellcasting-sorcerer"></a>Spellcasting
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or
ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with
arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin,
fuels your spells.
##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from
the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.
##### Spell Slots
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast
one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell
slots when you finish a long rest.\
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning
hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.
##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the
sorcerer spell list.\
The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table
shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your
choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd
level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st
or 2nd level.\
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.
##### Spellcasting Ability
**Charisma** is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer
spells, since the power of your magic relies on your
ability to project your will into the world. You use your
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell
you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
>**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier\
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for 
your sorcerer spells.

#### Sorcerous Origin
Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the
source of your innate magical power:
* [Draconic Bloodline](#draconic-bloodline)
* [Wild Magic](#wild-magic)
* [Divine Soul](#divine-soul)
* [Shadow Magic](#shadow-magic)
* [Storm Sorcery](#storm-sorcery)

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at
1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.
#### Font of Magic
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic
within yourself. This wellspring is represented by
sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of
magical effects.
#### Sorcery Points
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you
reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points
colum n of the Sorcerer table. You can never have
more sorcery points than shown on the table for your
level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you
finish a long rest.
#### Flexible Casting
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell
slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery
points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points
as you reach higher levels.\
**Creating Spell Slots.** You can transform unexpended
sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on
your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table show s the cost
of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create
spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Spell Slot Level |Sorcery Point Cost
-|-
1st |2
2nd |3
3rd |5
4th |6
5th |7
**Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.** As a
bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell
slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the
slot’s level.

#### Metamagic
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells
to suit your needs. You gain two of the following
Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one
at 10th and 17th level.\
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell
when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
##### Careful Spell
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make
a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures
from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery
point and choose a number of those creatures up to your
Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen
creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw
against the spell.
##### Distant Spell
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or
greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the
range of the spell.\
When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you
can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the
spell 30 feet.
##### Empowered Spell
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1
sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must
use the new rolls.\
You can use Em powered Spell even if you have
already used a different Metamagic option during the
casting of the spell.
##### Extended Spell
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute
or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its
duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
##### Heightened Spell
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a
saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery
points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its
first saving throw made against the spell.
##### Quickened Spell
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action,
you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting
time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
##### Subtle Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
cast it without any som atic or verbal components.
##### Twinned Spell
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and
doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of
sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second
creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if
the spell is a cantrip).
#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
#### Sorcerous Restoration
At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points
whenever you finish a short rest.

### Sorcerous Origins

#### Draconic Bloodline
Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was
mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most
often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent
back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a
bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed
a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well
established in the world, but most are obscure. Any
given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a
result of a pact or some other exceptional circum stance.
##### Dragon Ancestor
At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your
ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon
is used by features you gain later.
Dragon |Damage Type
-|-
Black |Acid
Blue |Lightning
Brass| Fire
Bronze| Lightning
Copper| Acid
Cold |Fire
Green| Poison
Red |Fire
Silver| Cold
White |Cold
You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally,
whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting
with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it
applies to the check.
##### Draconic Resilience
As magic flows through your body, it causes physical
traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level,
your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by
1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin
sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing
armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
##### Elemental Affinity
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals
damage of the type associated with your draconic
ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage.
At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain
resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.
##### Dragon Wings
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of
dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed
equal to your current speed. You can create these wings
as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you
dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\
You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor
unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and
clothing not made to accommodate your wings might
be destroyed when you manifest them.
##### Draconic Presence
Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread
presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around
you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action,
you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power
and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a
distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your
concentration (as if you were casting a concentration
spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this
aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose
fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on
this saving throw is im mune to your aura for 24 hours.

#### Wild Magic
Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos
that underlie the order of creation. You might have
endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps
through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental
Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you
were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a
demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with
no apparent cause or reason. However it cam e to be, this
chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
##### Wild Magic Surge
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your
spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic.
Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level
or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a
1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random
magical effect.
![Wild Magic Table](WildMagicTable.PNG)
##### Tides of Chaos
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of
chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must
finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the
DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table
immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or
higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
##### Bend Luck
Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate
using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes 
an **attack roll**, **an ability check**, or a **saving throw**, 
you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery
points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a
bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You
can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects
of the roll occur.
##### Controlled Chaos
At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the
surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the
Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use
either number.
##### Spell Bombardment
Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your
spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and
roll the highest number possible on any of the dice,
choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to
the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

#### Divine Soul

##### DIVINE MAGIC
Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from
the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you
learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of
1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from
the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must
otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the
spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.\
In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your
divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You
learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown
below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count
against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you
later replace this spell, you must replace it with a Spell
from the cleric spell list.
Affinity |Spell
-|-
Good |cure wounds
Evil |inflict wounds
Law |bless
Chaos |bone
Neutrality |protectionfrom evil and good
##### FAVORED BY THE GODS
Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny.
Ifyou fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you
can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing
the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a short or long rest.
##### EMPOWERED HEALING
Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through
you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of 
you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, 
you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once,
provided you aren't incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per 
turn.
##### OTHERWORLDLY WINGS
Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to
manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While
the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.
The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you
dismiss them as a bonus action.\
The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature
determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle
wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and
dragonfly wings for neutrality.
##### UNEARTHLY RECOVERY
At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous
injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than
half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points 
equal to half your hit point maximum.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.

#### Shadow Magic

##### EYES OF THE DARK
Starting at lst level, you have darkvision with a range
of 120 feet.\
When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn
the darkness spell, which doesn’t count against your
number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can cast it by spending 
2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with 
sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.
##### STRENGTH OF THE GRAVE
Starting at lst level, your existence in a twilight state between life 
and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit 
points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On
a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can’t use
this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant
damage or by a critical hit.\
After the saving throw succeeds, you can’t use this
feature again until you finish a long rest.
##### HOUND OF ILL OMEN
At 6th level, you gain the ability to call. forth a howling
creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus
action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically
summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you
can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire
wolf’s statistics (see the Monster Manual or appendix C
in the Player’s Handbook), with the following changes:
* The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as
a monstrosity, not a beast. 
* It appears with a number of temporary hit points
equal to half your sorcerer level. 
* It can move through other creatures and objects as
if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force
damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 
* At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows
its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no
longer hidden from the hound.

The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your
choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the
hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by
the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its 
target. The hound can make opportunity attacks,
but only against its target. \
Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target 
has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound
disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is
reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.
##### SHADOW WALK
At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one
shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus 
action, you can magically teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space 
you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.
##### UMBRAL FORM
Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action 
to magically transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you 
have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you
can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult 
terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.
You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if
you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a
bonus action.

#### Storm Sorcery

##### WIND SPEAKER
The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can speak,
read, and write Primordial.\
Knowing this language allows you to understand and
be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan,
Auran, Ignan, and Terran.
##### TEMPESTUOUS MAGIC
Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your
turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly
surround you, immediately before or after you cast a
spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up
to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
##### HEART OF THE STORM
At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder
damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell
of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder
damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption
causes creatures of your choice that you can see within
10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage
(choose each time this ability activates) equal to half
your sorcerer level.
##### STORM GUIDE
At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the
weather around you.\
If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain
to stop falling in a 20-foot—radius sphere centered on
you. You can end this effect as a bonus action.\
If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each
round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a
100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows
in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn't alter the speed of the wind.
##### STORM’S FURY
Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use 
your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals 
your sorcerer level.
The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw
against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save,
the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet
away from you.
##### WIND SOUL
At 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage.
You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an
action. you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1
hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet
of you equal to **3 + your Charisma modifier**. The chosen
creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1
hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you
can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
