the equipment granted by your background:
* (a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon
* (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon
* An explorer’s pack and four javelins

#### Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
aren’t wearing heavy armor:
* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
saving throws.
* When you make a melee weapon attack using
Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown
in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
concentrate on them while raging.\
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
on your turn as a bonus action.\
Once you have raged the number of times shown
for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
Barbarian table, you must finish a **long rest** before you
can rage again.

#### Unarmored Defense
While you are not wearing any armor, your Arm or Class
equals 
> **10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution
modifier.**

You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

#### Reckless Attack
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern
for defense to attack with fierce desperation. \
When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on
melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until
your next turn.

#### Danger Sense
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things
nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge
when you dodge away from danger.\

against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.
To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or
incapacitated.

* [Path of the Totem Warrior](#path-of-the-totem-warrior)
* [Path of the Ancestral Guardian](#path-of-the-ancestral-guardian)
* [Path of the Storm Herald](#path-of-the-storm-herald)
* [Path of the Zealot](#path-of-the-zealot)

14th levels.

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Feral Instinct
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have
advantage on initiative rolls.
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of
combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally
on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before
doing anything else on that turn.

#### Brutal Critical
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional
weapon damage die when determining the extra
damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
This increases to two additional dice at 13th level
and three additional dice at 17th level

#### Relentless Rage
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting
despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points
while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you
drop to 1 hit point instead.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC
increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the
DC resets to 10.

#### Persistent Rage
Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that
it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you
choose to end it.

#### Indomitable Might
Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength
check is less than your Strength score, you can use that
score in place of the total.

#### Primal Champion
At 20th level, you em body the power of the wilds. Your
Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your
maximum for those scores is now 24.

### Primal Paths

#### Path of the Berserker
For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end - that
end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path
of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter
the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle,
heedless of your own health or well-being.
##### Frenzy
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you
can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for
the duration of your rage you can make a single melee
weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns
after this one. when your rage ends, you suffer one level
of exhaustion.
##### Mindless Rage
Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or
frightened while raging. If you are charmed or
frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
suspended for the duration of the rage.
##### Intimidating Presence
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to
frighten someone with your menacing presence.
W en you do so, choose one creature that you can see
within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear
you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC
equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your
next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action
to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened
creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends
if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more
than 60 feet away from you.
If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't
use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
##### Retaliation
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from
a creature that is within 5 feet of you. you can use
your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against
that creature.

#### Path of the Totem Warrior
The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as
the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector,
and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you
with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your
barbarian rage.\
Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be
kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for
an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit,
though exceptions exist.
##### Spirit Seeker
Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural
world, giving you a kinship with beasts.\
At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to 
cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as 
rituals, as described in chapter 10.
##### Totem Spirit
At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a
totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or
acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar
adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws,
teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you
also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent
of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear
totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thickskinned, or 
if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.
Your totem animal might be an animal related to those
listed here but more appropriate to your homeland.
For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in
place of an eagle.
* Bear. While raging, you have resistance to all damage
except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you
tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
* Eagle. While you're raging and aren’t wearing
heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on
opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the
Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit
of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave
through the fray with ease.
* Wolf, While you're raging, your friends have
advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature
within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of
the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.
##### Aspect of the Beast
At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the
totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same
animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.
* Bear. You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying
capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift)
is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks
made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
* Eagle. You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can
see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern
even fine details as though looking at something no
more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim
light doesn't im pose disadvantage on your Wisdom
(Perception) checks.
* Wolf, You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You
can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace,
and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal
pace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace).
##### Spirit Walker
At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature
spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual
version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit
or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the
information you seek.
##### Totemic Attunement
At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a
totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same
animal you selected previously or a different one.
* Bear. While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet
of you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack
rolls against targets other than you or another character
with this feature. An enemy is im mune to this effect if it
can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.
* Eagle. While raging, you have a flying speed equal to
your current walking speed. This benefit works only in
short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and
nothing else is holding you aloft.
* Wolf. While you’re raging, you can use a bonus action
on your turn to knock a Large or sm aller creature prone
when you hit it with melee weapon attack.

#### Path of the Ancestral Guardian
##### Ancestral Protectors
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral
warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re
raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your
turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder
its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target
has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against
you, and when the target hits a creature other than you
with an attack, that creature has resistance to the dam—
age dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends
early ifyour rage ends.
##### Spirit Shield
Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you
can provide supernatural protection to those you de—
fend. If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your
reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.
When you reach certain levels in this class. you can
reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by
4d6 at 14th level.
##### Consult the Spirits
At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your
ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury or clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material
components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor,
this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one Of your
ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your
spellcasting ability for these spells.
After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use
this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
##### Vengeful Ancestors
At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful
enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to
reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your
Spirit Shield prevents.

#### Path of the Storm Herald
##### STORM AURA
Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you
in every direction, but not through total cover. Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter
your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each
of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or
tundra. Your aura’s effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.\
If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC
equals **8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier**. \
**Desert.** When this effect is activated, all other crea—
tures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage
increases when you reach certain levels in this class, in—
creasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level,
and 6 at 20th level.\
**Sea.** When this effect is activated, you can choose one
other creature you can see in your aura. The target must
make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, 
increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.\
**Tundra.** When this effect is activated, each creature of
your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as
icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points
increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level,
and 6 at 20th level.
##### STORM SOUL
At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when
your aura isn’t active. The benefits are based on the en—
vironment you chose for your Storm Aura.\
**Desert.** You gain resistance to fire damage, and you
don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat, as described in
the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Moreover, as an action,
you can touch a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.\
**Sea.** You gain resistance to lightning damage, and
you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming
speed of 30 feet.\
**Tundra.** You gain resistance to cold damage, and you
don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold, as described in
the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Moreover, as an action,
you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube Of it into ice,
which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature
is in the cube.
##### SHIELDING STORM
At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm
to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the
damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul fea
ture while the creature is in your Storm Aura. *
##### RAGING STORM
At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows
mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on
the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.\
**Desert.** Immediately after a creature in your aura hits
you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force
that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half
your barbarian level.\
**Sea.** When you hit a creature in your aura with an
attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature
to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave. \
**Tundra.** Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can 
choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on 
a Strength savingthrow, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of 
yournext turn, as magical frost covers it.

#### Path of the Zealot
##### DIVINE FURY
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can
channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While
you’re raging, the first creature you hit on each of your
turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal
to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is
necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when
you gain this feature.
##### WARRIOR OF THE GODS
At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a
spell, such as raise dead, has the sole effect of restoring
you to life (but not uncleath), the caster doesn’t need material components to cast the spell on you.
##### FANATICAL FOCUS
Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your
rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while
you’re raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the
new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.
##### ZEALOUS PRESENCE
At 10th level, you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in 
others. As a bonus action, you unleasha battle cry infused with divine 
energy. Up to ten othercreatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that 
canhear you gain advantage on attack rolls and savingthrows until the 
start of your next turn.\
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.
##### RAGE BEYOND DEATH
Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your
rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.\
While you’re raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock
you unconscious. You still must make death saving
throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking
damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die
due to failing death saving throws, you don"t die until
your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0
hit points.
